        A release is an event where a planned set of changes are tested and delivered to production, or more specifically, a final pipeline stage.
        Releases can vary in conceptual size, from a major product launch, to a single-line change rushed to production in an emergency.
        The deployment unit that is promoted through a pipeline in order to effectively deploy a release is referred to as a
        <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/core-concepts/build">build</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to the application code you want to deploy, releases have several associated features available to automate and coordinate 
        the software release process:
    </p>
    <ul class="docs">
        <li>Dates and milestones</li>
        <li>Issues and changes</li>
        <li>Configuration file changes</li>
        <li>Database change scripts</li>
        <li>Release notes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="creating-release" data-title="Creating Releases">Creating Releases</h2>
    <p>
        After creating an <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/modeling-applications/applications">application</a> and a 
        <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/core-concepts/pipelines">pipeline</a>, a release may be created for an application. 
        A release has the following initial properties:
    </p>
    <ul class="docs">
        <li><b>Release template</b> - if one exists, a <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/core-concepts/release/templates">release template</a> may be selected to determine variable prompts, default pipeline, and more </li>
        <li><b>Release number</b> - is a one-to-three part number (e.g. 88, 2.4, or 4.1.8) that uniquely identifies a release within an application</li>
        <li>
            <b>Release name</b> - is  an optional alias you can use to create a friendlier release identifier; it is not unique within an application
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Pipeline</b> - is the sequence of stages and approvals that builds are promoted through
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Once a release is created, you can add <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/global-components/configuration-variables">configuration variables</a> that can be used by deployment plans at runtime, target dates that will be show on a <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/modeling-applications/calendars">calendar</a>, and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
        See the <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/core-concepts/build">builds</a> documentation for more information on creating
        and deploying builds.
    </p>

    <h2 id="status-lifecycles" data-title="Status and Lifecycles">Status and Lifecycles</h2>
    <p>
        A release can be in one of three statuses that reflect the state of development:
    </p>
    <ul class="docs">
        <li>
            <b>Active</b> - builds are being created and deployed through pipelines
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Deployed</b> - a build was deployed to the final stage of its pipeline
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Canceled</b> - no build was deployed to the final stage, and builds are no longer being created or deployed; all builds are also rejected
        </li>

    </ul>
