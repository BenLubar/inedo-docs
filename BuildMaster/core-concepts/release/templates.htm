    <p>Release templates are designed to add a layer of consistency to the release creation process by assigning default properties (e.g. pipeline selection, initially-included deployables), prompting for variables at various points during the release lifecycle, and simplifying Release &amp; Deployment API usage.</p>
    <p>Release templates are scoped per-application, but can be easily copied into different applications via the JSON text mode.</p>
    <h2>Components</h2>
    <p>Release templates consist of 3 primary components:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Pipeline</strong> - the default pipeline selection when creating a release</li>
        <li><strong>Deployables</strong> - the default deployables to be included or referenced when creating a release</li>
        <li><strong>Template Variable Prompts</strong> - defines the variable prompts that occur at release creation, release package creation, and deployment to a pipeline stage. The configurations for template variables are the only settings in a release template that are considered "live", such that changing them could change the prompts when release packages are created or deployed for releases currently assigned to the template.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="var-config">Template Variables and Configurations</h3>
    <h4 id="hierarchy">Hierarchy</h4>
    <p>Release template variables are configurable at any of 3 levels:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Release creation</strong> - when creating a new release, inputs will appear for the specified variables and once the release is created, corresponding <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/reference/functions/releases/releasevariable">Release Variables</a> will be created. These variable values may be edited later on the Release Details page.</li>
        <li><strong>Release Package creation</strong> - when creating a new release package of a release with a template assigned, inputs will appear for the specified variables and once the release package is created, corresponding <i>Release Package Variables</i> will be created. These variable values may be edited later on the Release Package Details page.</li>
        <li><strong>Deployment to a pipeline stage</strong> - when deploying a release package of a release with a template assigned, inputs will appear on the "Deploy to Stage" page and once deployment begins, corresponding <i>Execution Variables</i> will be injected into the deployment and are not editable (though they may be overridden within a deployment plan using the <a href="/support/documentation/executionengine/otterscript/statements-and-blocks/other-statements">Set Variable statement</a>).</li>
    </ol>
    <h4 id="types">Types</h4>
    <p>There are 4 types of Template Variables:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Text</strong> - a simple string value whose prompt is rendered as a textbox</li>
        <li><strong>Checkbox</strong> - a simple boolean value with optional description whose prompt is rendered as a checkbox</li>
        <li><strong>List</strong> - a collection of multiple values defined in the template variable configuration whose prompt is rendered either as a dropdown list or a tag-textbox if the list is not restricted to the elements specified in the configuration</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic List</strong> - a collection of values such as a list of BuildMaster servers, environments, or any external source (e.g. ProGet package IDs/versions). These values are extensible and can be added via <i>List Variable Sources</i>. The prompt is rendered as a textbox with autocomplete values generated from the configuration source.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4 id="common">Common Template Variable Configuration</h4>
    <p>Each of the 4 template variable types can be configured in different ways, but the following options are shared for all of them:</p>
    <ul class="docs">
        <li><strong>Initial value</strong> - the pre-populated value that will appear in a rendered variable prompt</li>
        <li><strong>Required</strong> - indicates that a value must be present to continue creating the release/package or to deploy</li>
        <li><strong>Obscure the value of this variable from casual viewing</strong> - indicates that when a corresponding release or release package variable is created, that it is hidden from the UI and will require additional edit permissions to view it. Note that this is not a means to "secure" a variable value which is handled through <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/global-components/resource-credentials">Resource Credentials</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Creating a Release Template</h2>
    <p>To create a release template, in the context of an application, select the Releases tab under the Releases project sub-navigation menu. While the UI editor is the recommended method to create release templates, it is also possible to create them from a <a href="#json">JSON object</a>.</p>
    <h2>Using a Release Template</h2>
    <p>Once a release template is created, it can be used in one of two places: either creating a new release from the UI, or the <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/reference/api/release-and-package#create-release-from-template">Create Release from Template</a> API endpoint.</p>
    <p>If there is only a single release template for an application, that release template selected by default when creating a new release. Once a release is assigned a release template, any of the 3 variables properties that contain template variable configurations will then prompt for values as per the <a href="#hierarchy">Hierarchy</a> section above.</p>
    <p>A release may be assigned a different release template at any time while the release is active, however note that this can change the variable prompts whose values may be expected by a deployment plan.</p>
