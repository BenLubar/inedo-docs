BuildMaster can create and manage build artifacts for any deployment target, from simple ZIP files to complex container orchestrations in the cloud. 

### [BuildMaster-hosted artifacts](packaging/artifacts)
Artifacts are essentially zip files that are associated with a build, and may be created or deleted at any point during the lifecycle of an active build. Artifact files themselves are not limited to build output, they commonly also contain documentation files, reports, or any other relevant file or set of that may need to be kept or deployed.

### [ProGet-hosted Universal Packages](packaging/universal-packages)
You can also create a [Universal Package](/docs/upack/universal-packages/package-format) as part of your build and publish it to a feed in ProGet.  This too is essentially a zip file, but it contains a manifest file that describes the contents and can be pulled by other tools, instead of having to be deployed by BuildMaster. 

BuildMaster keeps track of these externally-hosted packages using a [Package Source](packaging/package-sources)

### Docker Container Images
You can also use `Docker` within BuildMaster to create container images and publish them to a private registry like ProGet.

Like packages, BuildMaster will keep track of these externally-hosted container images using a [Container Source](packaging/package-sources)
