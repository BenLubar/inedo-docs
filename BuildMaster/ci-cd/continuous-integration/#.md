Continuous Integration (CI) is the concept of automatically creating a build immediately following a commit to a source control system. BuildMaster supports 3 methods to achieve a fully-automated CI workflow:

 - **[Build Triggers & Scheduled Jobs](continuous-integration/build-triggers-and-monitors)** â€“ using repository monitors, webhooks, and scheduled jobs to trigger new builds and other actions.
 - **[Release &amp; Build API](/support/documentation/buildmaster/reference/api/release-and-build)** - the most general method to create builds from a third-party system, whether TeamCity, Jenkins, TFS, or others
 - **[Importing From a Drop Path](/support/documentation/buildmaster/builds/external-systems/drop-path)** - export builds or artifacts to a predetermined drop path, and capture them in BuildMaster
