A release is an event where a planned set of changes are tested and delivered to production, or more specifically, a final pipeline stage. Releases can vary in conceptual size, from a major product launch, to a single-line change rushed to production in an emergency. The deployment unit that is promoted through a pipeline in order to effectively deploy a release is referred to as a [build](/support/documentation/buildmaster/core-concepts/build).

In addition to the application code you want to deploy, releases have several associated features available to automate and coordinate the software release process:

{.docs}
- Dates and milestones
- Issues and changes
- Configuration file changes
- Database change scripts
- Release notes

## Creating Releases {#creating-releases data-title="Creating Releases"}

After creating an [application](/support/documentation/buildmaster/modeling-applications/applications) and a [pipeline](/support/documentation/buildmaster/core-concepts/pipelines), a release may be created for an application. A release has the following initial properties:

{.docs}
- **Release template** - if one exists, a [release template](/support/documentation/buildmaster/core-concepts/release/templates) may be selected to determine variable prompts, default pipeline, and more
- **Release number** - is a one-to-three part number (e.g. 88, 2.4, or 4.1.8) that uniquely identifies a release within an application
- **Release name** - is  an optional alias you can use to create a friendlier release identifier; it is not unique within an application
- **Pipeline** - is the sequence of stages and approvals that builds are promoted through

Once a release is created, you can add [configuration variables](/support/documentation/buildmaster/global-components/configuration-variables) that can be used by deployment plans at runtime, target dates that will be show on a [calendar](/support/documentation/buildmaster/modeling-applications/calendars), and so on.

## Deployment {#builds data-title="Deployment"}

See the [builds](/support/documentation/buildmaster/core-concepts/build) documentation for more information on creating and deploying builds.

## Status and Lifecycles {#status-lifestyles data-title="Status and Lifecycles"}

A release can be in one of three statuses that reflect the state of development:

{.docs}
- **Active** - builds are being created and deployed through pipelines
- **Deployed** - a build was deployed to the final stage of its pipeline
- **Canceled** - no build was deployed to the final stage, and builds are no longer being created or deployed; all builds are also rejected
