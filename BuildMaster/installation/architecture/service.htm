        The BuildMaster Service is key component of BuildMaster's <a href="architecture">architecture</a>, and is 
        what actually runs your <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/core-concepts/deployment-plans">deployment plans</a> using the 
        <a href="../execution-engine">execution engine</a>.  It's a standard  
        <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms685141(v=vs.85).aspx">Windows Service Application</a>,  
        and may be managed and configured using the Windows Service Manager or <code>sc.exe</code> as you see fit.

    <p>
        In addition to stopping and starting the Otter Service, you can see the service's live logs; this may be helpful when
        diagnosing problems or working with Inedo's support team to track down unexpected behavior or bugs. 
    </p>
    <h2 id="task-runners" data-title="Task Runners">Task Runners</h2>
    <p>Task runners run well-defined background jobs, on either a periodic and/or manual basis. Many will create sub-tasks that allow you to better visualize what the service is doing. Some task runners can be manually triggered. This should only be needed in debugging purposes, as the Web Application will trigger them in response to certain actions (such as deploying a build), and they are always executed on service start.</p>

        By default, the BuildMaster Service is named <code>INEDOBMSVC</code>, runs under the
        <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms684272(v=vs.85).aspx">NetworkService</a> account,
        and is granted Read, Write, ListDirectory privileges to the following paths:

            <p>
                    If you choose to configure this as a custom domain account, it will be important to grant these same privileges.
