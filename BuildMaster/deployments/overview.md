BuildMaster automates deployments that target virtually any platform used by the applications in your organization. Deployment logic is written in OtterScript, a domain-specific language used by the [Inedo Execution Engine](plans/execution-engine), but may also be edited in a visual plan editor for convenience and simplicity.
