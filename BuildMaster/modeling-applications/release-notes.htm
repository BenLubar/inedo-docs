                There are times when you'll want to attach additional information to a release or build, usually to document something for later auditing purposes, or to share information with another team member. 
   </p>
   <p>
                For example, you might want to document some of the following:       
   </p>
   <ul class="docs">
     <li>  The reason for using a different pipeline for the release instead of the usual one</li>
     <li>   Why a release was un-canceled  </li>
      <li>  Special testing considerations </li>
      <li>  Deployment issues found in a specific build </li>
         
   </ul>
   <p>
                BuildMaster facilitates this documentation through the use of release notes. Oftentimes, release notes will be helpful to model part of an existing release process.

   <p>
                You can create or edit a release note on either the release or build overview page.     
   </p>
   <p>
                Only users with specific permission to manage release notes are able to do this.

   <p>
                The "Create Release Note" operation allows you to add a note to the current release, or a release or build in any application via an operation in your deployment plan. You can put any text in the release note, including:     
   </p>
   <ul class="docs">
                <li>Corrective steps automatically executed using a try/catch statement after an error occurred during a deployment</li>
              <li>The ID of an issue created using an <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/modeling-applications/issues-projects">issue tracking tool operation</a></li>
             <li> The specific server used in a resource pool</li>
                
   </ul>
