            While OtterScript and PowerShell will allow you to automate just about anything, there are times when it’s simpler to do things manually. For example:
    </p>
    <ul class="docs">
           <li> Updating a version number on a WordPress page as a new release is being published</li>
          <li> Enabling a VPN to a customer site for a short time during a deployment</li>
          <li> Running an ancient GUI-based deployment for part of an application</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
            This is where the <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/reference/operations/buildmaster/manual-operation">Manual Operation</a> comes in: when executed in a deployment plan, the execution will halt until an assigned person indicates that a specified task has been completed.
    </p>
    <h2 id="using-plan" data-title="Using in a Deployment Plan"> Using in a Deployment Plan</h2>

    <p>
            You can add the Manual Operation to your plan just like you would any other operation, by dragging-and-dropping it from the statement list, or directly in OtterScript.
    </p>
    <inedo:tab-block>
            <tab name="Visual Mode">
                <img class="screenshot" src="/resources/documentation/buildmaster/6/manual-operation.png" alt="Manual operation Plan Block (Visual Mode)" />
            </tab>
            <tab name="Text Mode (OtterScript)">
<pre>
Perform-ManualOperation
(
    Name: Run HDARS-Deployer,
    Description: "Log onto HDARS server, run the desktop hdars-deployer.exe app and follow instructions",
    AssignedTo: Deployer,
    SendEmail: true
);                                                      
</pre>
            </tab>
        </inedo:tab-block>
<p>
        When this statement is encountered, the execution engine will first send an email (if specified) to the user and/or groups specified with a link to their My Tasks page in BuildMaster. You can also specify additional email addresses in the Advanced tab.    
</p>
<p>
        From the My Tasks page, a user can see all pending manual tasks, and mark them complete as needed.  After marking a manual task complete, the execution can continue.

        Manual tasks can also help you debug a deployment plan.

<ul class="docs">
   <li><b>Inspect working directory;</b> If an operation is failing, indicating that files are missing from the current working directory, or are otherwise different than expected, you can simply put a manual operation immediately before the failing operation to investigate the state of the working directory
   </li>  
      <li><b>  Manual error handling;</b> you can place a manual operation in the error handler of a Try/Catch statement to allow for manual intervention </li>
        
</ul>
