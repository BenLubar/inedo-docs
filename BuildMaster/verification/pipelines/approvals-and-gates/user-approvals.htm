    <p>
        There are two types of manual approvals: user and group. A user-based approval can only be entered by the specified user, whereas a group-based approval can be entered by any members of the specified group. You can also specify that more than one member of a particular group must approve a build before deploying to a stage.
    </p>
    <p>
        In either case, when a user approves a build, the following is recorded:
    </p>
    <ul class="docs">
        <li>User's Name</li>
        <li>Group name (if group-based)</li>
        <li>Stage name</li>
        <li>Approval Description</li>
        <li>User Comments</li>
        <li>Date/Time</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Users may revoke a manual approval they've given, provided that the build wasn't already deployed to the target stage.
    </p>
