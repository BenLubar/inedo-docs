    <p>
        You can also define automatic checks that must be met before a build may be deployed to a stage. These are an <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/administration/extensions">extensible feature</a>, and there are several built in to BuildMaster.

    <p>
        These automatic approvals are verified periodically, as they can change over time.
    </p>

    <div class="attention analogy">
        <img src="/resources/images/icons/analogy.png" />
        <p>
            For example, if you've configured a Issues Closed automatic approval to verify that issues in a particular JIRA project are closed prior to promoting to a stage,
            BuildMaster won't be notified of a status change. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        When an automatic approval is verified, the following information is recorded:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>State (Met, Not Met, Not Required)</b>- for example, if there are no issues associated with the release, then the requirement would be Not Met, whereas the requirement would be Met only if all issues associated with the release were Resolved
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Description</b> - a text description of the approval conditions; for example, "3/8 issues are resolved"
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>
                Date/Time
            </b>- a timestamp of when the approval was run
        </li>
    </ul>
