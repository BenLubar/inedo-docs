## Configuring Continuous Integration {#continuous-integration data-title="Continuous Integration"}

Continuous Integration (CI) is the concept of automatically creating a build immediately following a commit to a source control system. BuildMaster supports 3 methods to achieve a fully-automated CI workflow:
    
 - **[Repository monitors](continuous-integration/repository-monitors)** â€“ supports	polling a generic repository for changes
 - **[Repository hooks](continuous-integration/repository-hooks)** - supports immediate build creation from GitHub or GitLab, but may require support for incoming push notification requests from the internet
 - **[Release &amp; Build API](/docs/buildmaster/reference/api/release-and-build)** - the most general method to create builds from a third-party system, whether TeamCity, Jenkins, TFS, or others
 - **[Importing From a Drop Path](/docs/buildmaster/builds/external-systems/drop-path)** - export builds or artifacts to a predetermined drop path, and capture them in BuildMaster
