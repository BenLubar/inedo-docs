## Configuring Continuous Integration {#continuous-integration data-title="Continuous Integration"}

Continuous Integration (CI) is the concept of automatically creating a build immediately following a commit to a source control system. BuildMaster supports 3 methods to achieve a fully-automated CI workflow:

    
 - **[Build Triggers & Scheduled Jobs](continuous-integration/build-triggers-and-monitors)** – using repository monitors, webhooks, and scheduled jobs to trigger new builds and other actions.
 - **[Repository monitors](continuous-integration/repository-monitors)** – supports	polling a generic repository for changes
 - **[Repository hooks](continuous-integration/repository-hooks)** - supports immediate build creation from GitHub or GitLab, but may require support for incoming push notification requests from the internet
 - **[Release &amp; Build API](/support/documentation/buildmaster/reference/api/release-and-build)** - the most general method to create builds from a third-party system, whether TeamCity, Jenkins, TFS, or others
