Build plans are the instructions that tell BuildMaster exactly how to build and package your applications in preparation for deployment.

  They are written in language called OtterScript, and can be developed using the drag-and-drop editor. This saves you from having to learn the syntax before you can start building a plan. You can switch back-and-forth between visual and text modes to get a feel for the syntax and structure of the language pretty quickly, and master it in no time.

For more information on syntax, visit the [Deployment Plans](/support/documentation/buildmaster/deployments/plans) section.
