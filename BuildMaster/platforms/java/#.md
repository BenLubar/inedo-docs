Java is one of the top five programming languages in the software ecosystem, running on billions of devices from global cloud systems to single-board computers like Raspberry Pi. 

Jakarta EE is the de-facto set of multi-tier specifications and extensions to Java SE that enable enterprise application services such as:

{.docs}
 - Servlets
 - JavaServer Faces (JSF) *(component based UI for web apps)*
 - Web services
 - Framework libraries & APIs:
   - Dependency injection
   - Persistence
   - Transactions

Formerly known as Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) and Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE), it is sponsored by the [Eclipse Foundation] and contributed to by Oracle.

The most common Java application servers are: 

{.docs} 
 - Oracle WebLogic
 - Apache TomEE
 - Eclipse Glassfish (formerly Oracle)
 - IBM WebSphere
 - Red Hat WildFly (formerly JBoss Application Server) 
 - JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) (paid version of WildFly)

When deploying Java locally or to small web servers, the most common web servers are:

{.docs}
 - Eclipse Jetty
 - [Apache Tomcat](java/tomcat)

## Building Java Applications {#building data-title="Build Process"}

Java programs are compiled into [bytecode](LINK) as `.class` files and packaged into one of many types of [JAR files]. At run time, bytecode is interpreted and executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). To develop Java, you'll always develop against the [Java Development Kit (JDK)].

Common tools used to build and test Java programs are:

{.docs}
 - **javac** - primary Java compiler included with the JDK
 - [**maven**](java/maven) - most common XML-based build and deployment tool with all the support of ant plus dependency management, packaging, publish support
 - [**ant**](java/ant) - basic build tool with customizable XML build tasks
 - **gradle** - similar to maven but uses a [Groovy-based configuration file]
 - [**JUnit**](java/junit) - most common unit test framework for Java applications

## Automation with BuildMaster {#buildmaster data-title="Automation with BuildMaster"}

At a high level, the process of building and deploying Java applications with BuildMaster is:

{.docs}
 - Get source code from the source control repository
 - Compile project with maven
 - Capture artifact for deployment

## Deploying Java Applications {#deployment data-title="Deployment Process"}

Java applications in an enterprise are typically deployed to on-premise or to hosted application servers such as:

{.docs}
 - IBM WebSphere
 - Oracle WebLogic
 - Red Hat JBoss/WildFly
 - Tomcat

Deployment to application servers involves running a host-specific "deploy" command on a remote server, typically with a WAR file as an input argument.

Deploying to web servers is a little different. Deploying to Tomcat servers, for example, follows the common format:

{.docs}
 - Stop Tomcat services
 - Deploy WAR file
 - Start Tomcat services
