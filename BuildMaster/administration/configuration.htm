        BuildMaster allows you to visualize the infrastructure your release pipelines target, and also gives you the ability to import and export infrastructure configuration. This makes sharing and maintaining your infrastructure configuration that much easier.
    </p>

    <h2 id="export" data-title="Export">Exporting Infrastructure Configuration</h2>
    <p>
        You can export all of your instance's infrastructure configuration
        (<a href="../core-concepts/servers">servers</a>,
        <a href="../core-concepts/environments">environments</a>, and
        <a href="../modeling-infrastructure/server-roles">server roles</a>)
        as a JSON file. Once exported, you can simply edit the file (adding or removing any number of infrastructure items) and import,
        share it with another instance of Otter or BuildMaster, or maintain it as a simple back-up.
    </p>

    <h2 id="import" data-title="Import">Importing Infrastructure Configuration</h2>
    <p>
        The <em>import</em> function allows you to quickly configure or make massive changes to BuildMaster's infrastructure configuration
        by importing the configuration file that was exported from another instance of Otter or BuildMaster.
    </p>
    <p>
        By using the "dry run" option you can see the changes that <em>would be made</em> before actively making the changes.
    </p>

    <h2 id="sync" data-title="Synchronize">Infrastructure Synchronization</h2>
    <p>
        It's quite common to use <a href="/otter"> Otter</a> for managing server configuration, and BuildMaster for application release automation; because
        they both use the same set of servers, you can synchronize the infrastructure between multiple instances.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you enable infrastructure synchronization, your BuildMaster instance connects to either a BuildMaster or Otter instance, pulls configuration from that instance,
        and updates the infrastructure configuration as needed. 
    </p>
    <p class="announcement">
        When synchronization is enabled, the other instance should be treated as the <em>source of truth</em>. There will also be
        limited options in the Otter UI for editing configuration, as they would almost immediately be wiped-out when a synchronization occurs.
    </p>
    <p>
        To have another instance of BuildMaster or Otter synchronize with your instance, simply create an API key with view infrastructure permissions.
