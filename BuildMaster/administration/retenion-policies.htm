      BuildMaster retains a <em>lot</em> of logs; this is great when you need to debug what went wrong, audit deployments,
      and so on -- but it's not so great when you start running out of disk space. This is where <em>retention policies</em> come in.
   </p>
    <p>
        Retention policies may be created that will allow the system to reclaim
        disk space and/or database space depending on the configured policy. Policies may be filtered
        by application, application group, or pipeline, and may also specify a time window that can be used to prevent
        the retention policy from executing its purge methods during normal operational hours.

    </p>

   <p>
      There are 4 possible objects that can be purged by configuring a retention policy, and each may be filterable additionally
      by release status, release package status, and/or environment:
   </p>
   <ul class="docs">
      <li><strong>Releases</strong> - purges all filtered release data including promotions, builds, executions, and logs</li>
      <li><strong>Release Packages</strong> - purges all filtered package data including promotions, executions, and logs</li>
      <li><strong>Execution Logs</strong> - purges all execution logs associated with specific environments</li>
      <li><strong>Artifacts</strong> - purges artifact files from disk</li>
   </ul>
  <p class="info">
    <strong>Note:</strong> purging either Releases and Packages <strong>will not</strong> purge artifacts from disk
    for those packages. To clean up the artifact zip files from disk, a second retention policy must be added with the 
    option to "purge orphaned artifacts" checked.
  </p>
   
   <h3 id="retention-filtering-options" data-title="Retention Filtering &amp; Options">Retention Filtering &amp; Options</h3>
   <p>
      Retention policies will only perform purges if the criteria specified in a particular policy is met.
      There are 7 main filters that apply to most purge objects:
   </p>
   <ul class="docs">
      <li><strong>Application</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Application Group</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Workflow</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Environment</strong>  <i>(applies to purging logs only)</i></li>
      <li><strong>Time of Day</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Release Status</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Package Status</strong>  <i>(does not apply to purging releases)</i></li>
   </ul>
   <p>
      Beyond these standard filter options, you may also configure additional retention filtering that prevents 
      certain items from being purged regardless if they match the filters or not:
   </p>
   <ul class="docs">
      <li><strong>Count</strong> - keep the last N items</li>
      <li><strong>Days</strong> - only purge items if they are older than N days</li>
      <li><strong>Size</strong> - keep at least the last N MB worth of artifacts/logs</li>
   </ul>
  <p>
    Additionally, there is an option for the purge <strong>Build Artifacts</strong> type that will also purge artifacts from disk no longer have a reference to them within BuildMaster. 
      This setting will ignore any filters that may be applied and always delete all orphaned artifacts.
  </p>

   <p>
      Retention policies may also be forced to run immediately, bypassing any day/time window restrictions.
