        Event listeners are useful for monitoring the actions and operations that occur in deployment plans and pipelines in BuildMaster.
        Event Listeners trigger certain actions or tasks (such as sending an email) once the specified event occurs.
    </p>
    <p>
        BuildMaster has a handful of common built-in event listeners.

        Event listeners can be added either as a post deployment step in a <a href="/docs/buildmaster/verification/pipelines">pipeline</a> or specific to user via the <em>My Event Listener</em> user drop down.

     <p>
        Organizations often use event listeners when a specific person has ownership of an application or group of applications. 
        In this scenario, the owner of the application would receive an email when a build has been successfully deployed to production.

    <div class="attention">
        <p>The <strong>Email Notification: Approval Required</strong> event listener triggers on pipeline stage <em>completion</em>, not the start of a new pipeline stage. Because of this, when filtering to a specific pipeline stage, the name of the stage <em>before</em> the approval gate should be used, not the stage that is blocked by the gate.</p>
