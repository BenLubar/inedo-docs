	<p>
		Maven feeds contain a maven2-compatible Maven artifact repository. Maven works a little
		differently than the other feed types.
	</p>
	<h2 id="maven-specifics">Maven Specifics</h2>
	<p>
		Maven artifacts are not self-contained archives; instead, an artifact is more of a
		grouping of files with some associated metadata. Because of this distinction, Maven
		feeds do not support drop path imports.
	</p>
	<p>
		Connectors are also slightly different in Maven than in most other feed types. As there
		is no universal standard for searching or listing from a remote Maven repository, ProGet
		uses a rather dated API that provides an index of <em>all</em> artifacts. A task in
		the ProGet service will periodically download that index and unpack it to a local Lucene
		database, and use that for searching the remote repository. For the public apache Maven
		repository, this can be a very resource-intensive operation, and if you do not need this
		searching capability, we recommend disabling this task in ProGet. Artifacts accessed directly
		by name do <em>not</em> need this index.
	</p>
	<p>
		Maven feeds do not currently support alternate package stores (AWS, Azure). Support for both
		is <a href="https://inedo.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/issue/PG-1256" target="_blank">planned</a>
		for ProGet 5.1.0.
