        <a href="https://chocolatey.org/" target="_blank">Chocolatey</a> is a package manager for Windows.
        Similar to Linux tools like apt or yum, but designed specifically for Windows, Chocolatey
        was designed to be a decentralized framework for quickly installing applications and tools that you need.

    <h2 id="differences" data-title="Differences from NuGet">Differences from NuGet Feeds</h2>
    <p>
        Since Chocolatey is built on the NuGet infrastructure, a  Chocolatey feed in ProGet is actually a type
        of <a href="nuget">NuGet</a> feed. Functionally, it behaves exactly the same as a NuGet feed, but the
        user interface is optimized for Chocolatey packages:

    <ul class="docs">
        <li>
            Packages in Chocolatey feeds have a different icon to indicate that they
            are intended for use by Chocolatey
        </li>
        <li>
            Package install instructions also provide an example
            for installing the package using <code>choco</code> instead of NuGet
        </li>
    </ul>

        In the video below, Chocolatey founder Rob Reynolds presents a demo of ProGet and Chocolatey,
        reviewing how both come together to provide a complete Windows package management solution.
