      <p>
          A ProGet npm feed is a repository compatible with the npm client for NodeJS. ProGet npm
          feeds support both scoped and unscoped npm packages.
      </p>

      <h2>npm Feed Specifics</h2>
      <p>
          Connectors to the public repository at npmjs.org will not include <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scope">scoped packages</a>
          in search results, because the public repository does not have a mechanism for
          including them. Scoped packages can still be used through this connector; they are
          only excluded from searches, and this is the same behavior seen from searching
          at npmjs.org directly.
      </p>
      <p>
          The npm client does not support using Windows Integrated Authentication, so ProGet
          attempts to disable its usage for npm API endpoints in favor of basic HTTP authentication.
          However, disabling Windows Authentication on a per-URL basis does not work in every
          environment. If you are having trouble getting this working, you may create a second
          web site in IIS for ProGet with Windows Authentication disabled without acquiring
          a separate license.
      </p>

      <h2 id="getting-started">Creating an npm Feed</h2>
      <p>
          Click on the <i>Feeds</i> tab in the navigation bar, and you will see a list of feeds in the system.

      </p>

      <p>
          Click on the <i>Create New Feed</i> button and select <i>npm</i>.
      </p>


      <p>
          Supply a value for the <b>Feed name</b> field. This will be the name of
          your private npm registry, and should contain characters that can be
          easily typed in a URL. For instance, you could use <b>private-npm</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
          Click the <b>Create Feed</b> button, and you should be automatically directed to the newly-created registry.
      </p>

      <p>
          If your ProGet server has access to the Internet, you should see a listing
          of packages from npmjs.org. These are called <i>connector packages</i>,
          and are not hosted on your ProGet instance, but are transparently proxied
          from another server. After you create the npm feed, you can
          add a connector for <i>npmjs.org</i> directly within your feed or by clicking on
          the <b>Connectors</b> tab at the top of the page. This way you can have access to that
          rich library of packages in addition to your private ones. Connectors also
          allow filtering, if you would like to include only a subset of external
          packages; however, no filtering is performed by default. For more information
          about connectors, see the <a href="/support/documentation/proget/core-concepts/connectors">documentation</a>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="set-up-npm">Setting up npm</h2>
      <p>
          First, you will need to tell npm where to look for its registry; by default
          it will be configured for <i>npmjs.org</i>. Use the following command, substituting
          <b>proget</b> for the name name/port of your ProGet server, and
          <b>private-npm</b> for the name of the npm feed you created above.
      </p>

      <pre>[~]$ npm config set registry http://proget/npm/private-npm</pre>

      <p>
      </p>


      <h2>npm Token Authentication</h2>
      <p>
          In order to interact with your private registry without using the <b>npm adduser</b> command you will need to follow these steps.
          <ul>
              <li>
                  <b><a href="http://inedo.localhost/support/documentation/proget/administration/security/api-keys">Create an API Key</a></b> - you can create an API Key in ProGet (Admin > API Key &amp; Access Logs) with Feed Access. you can further restrict this key by associating it to a user you've already given specific permissions
              </li>
              <li>
                  <b>Encode The API Key</b> - Once the key has been generated you will need to encrypt the key along with the username <i>api</i>. This needs to be encoded in base64 format.
                  Your string prior to encoding should be: <pre>api:{APIKEY}</pre>. Once you have this token you will need set your _auth value with it using npm. It
                  is also recommended that you set always-auth to true.
              </li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <pre>

[~]$ npm config set always-auth=true<br />
[~]$ npm config set _auth={ENCODEDAPIKEY}

        </pre>
      <p>
      </p>


      <h2 id=" step-four">Publishing a Package</h2>
      <p>
          You can also publish packages to ProGet using npm. First, use the <b>adduser</b>
          command to log in as ProGet's default Admin account, and when prompted for
          a password, use the same one that you used to log in to ProGet (default is Admin).
      </p>
      <pre>

[~]$ npm adduser<br />
[~]$ npm publish package.tgz

</pre>
      <p>
      </p>
