      <p class="info"><strong>Note:</strong> This software is currently in Beta; screenshots are coming soon.</p>

	<p>
		The Inedo Hub is primarily used to install, update, and otherwise service applications in the Inedo Suite.
		Currently, it is used only for ProGet 5.1 and newer, but support for the other products will be rolled
		out throughout the year.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Installing the Hub</h2>
	<p>
		The Inedo Hub is itself a lightweight installable Windows app. Currently, it can be downloaded
		from the <a href="/proget/download">ProGet download page</a> as a small executable file that
		downloads and installs the latest version of the hub when you execute it.
	</p>

	<h2>Installation</h2>
	<p>
		All products require an instance of SQL Server (any version of SQL Server currently
		supported by Microsoft may be used). The Hub can download and install a SQL Express
		instance – if this option is selected, an “Inedo” instance of SQL Express is installed
		(if the Inedo instance is already present on the local machine, that will be used and
		SQL Express will not be downloaded and installed again). If a connection string is supplied,
		the Hub must have permission to create and modify databases.
	</p>
	<p>
		A web server is also required for all Inedo applications: the Hub can install products
		to use either an integrated web server or IIS. The integrated web server is easier to
		configure initially but lacks features that may be necessary in a production environment
		such as SSL support.
	</p>
	<p>
		If IIS is selected in the Hub but is not currently installed on the server, you will be
		prompted to install it. When installing using IIS hosting, the Hub creates an AppPool
		named [ProductName]AppPool and a Web Application called [ProductName].
	</p>
	<p>
		All products also require a license key from Inedo. The hub can request a free or trial
		key for you if you supply a name and email address, but you may also choose not to register
		at this time. If you install a product without registering, you will have to add the key within
		the software itself.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Upgrades</h2>
	<p>
		You can upgrade products to any greater version number by clicking on the Upgrade button and
		selecting the desired version. By default, the latest stable version is selected, but you can
		choose a lower version or a later prerelease version as well.
	</p>
	<p>
		Upgrades also required a connection string. By default, the connection string used by the application
		is used, but you may supply an alternative one to use for the upgrade instead (this is
		necessary if the software runs as a lower-privilege user not able to make schema changes and
		you are not using integrated authentication).
	</p>
	
	<h2>Uninstallation</h2>
	<p>
		Individual products can be uninstalled by clicking on its associated Uninstall button.
		The uninstall operation stops and removes all services, IIS sites and app pools, and
		removes installed program files. Uninstallation does <b>not</b> remove any databases
		or data files such as packages, artifacts, or extensions.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Service Inspection</h2>
	<p>
		The Services tab displays the status of all Windows services for each installed product.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Product Configuration</h2>
	<p>
		The Configuration tab displays entries stored in each product's configuration file. The
		configuration file stores a small number of key/value pairs that are unsuitable for storage
		in the associated database, such as: connection string, integrated web server configuration,
		and encryption key.
	</p>

	<h2>Uninstalling the Hub</h2>
	<p>
		The Inedo Hub has no background services and only occupies a few megabytes of disk space - it
		is simply an app designed to make managing your Inedo product installations easier, so we
		recommend keeping it installed unless you are totally removing every product on a server
		and will no longer need it.
	</p>
	<p>
		That said, The hub itself may be uninstalled by either using the Programs and Features
		dialog in Windows or executing the InedoHubUninstaller.exe program directly.
	</p>
	<p>
		Uninstalling the hub will <b>not</b> uninstall all of the individual Inedo products automatically.
		If you want to uninstall everything, use the hub to uninstall each product first.
	</p>

	<h2>Configuration and Offline Installs</h2>
	<p>
		Installable product packages are Universal Packages, and the hub uses a universal package
		feed hosted at inedo.com to download product releases and updates for the hub itself.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is still possible to use the Inedo Hub to install/manage products on a server that is not
		connected to the Internet, but it will take a little extra configuration. In order for
		the software to work, it needs to be able to query a Universal Package Feed for available
		product releases - you have two options for getting this to work on a disconnected server:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<b>Use ProGet</b> - If you have a ProGet instance on your local network, you can
			create a Universal Package Feed in it and then create a connector to the Inedo
			<a href="https://inedo.com/products/feed">product releases feed</a>. Make a note
			of the feed API Endpoint URL displayed in ProGet for the newly-created feed.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Use Directory</b> - Download the packages you need to a local directory.
			At a minimum, this should be the latest DesktopHub package and the desired
			ProGet package.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Once you have completed one of the above options, click the [config] link in the
		Inedo Hub and specify either the ProGet Feed URL or the file system directory
		containing downloaded packages for the Package Source field.
	</p>
