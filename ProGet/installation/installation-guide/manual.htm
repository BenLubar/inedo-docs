    <h2>Manual ProGet Installation</h2>
    <p class="attention technical">
        These manual installation instructions for ProGet are primarily for load balanced and high availability installations.
        If you aren't using these features, you should probably use the <a href="/proget/download">installer</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        ProGet consists of 3 main deployable components:
    </p>
    <ul class="docs">
        <li>
            <b>Web Application</b> – an ASP.NET 4.5 web application which serves as an interface to ProGet and serves the NuGet API
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Service</b> – performs indexing and other background tasks; hosts the web application if IIS is not used
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Database</b> – a SQL Server database which contains all of the persistent data including feeds and privileges
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Installation</h3>
    <p>
        Prior to installation of ProGet, a ProGet
        "home" directory needs to be created, such as C:\ProGet
    </p>
    <p>
        For the remainder of these instructions and simplicity, we will use <b>C:\ProGet</b> as
        the root - replace with the specific path you have chosen for your installation
        as necessary.
    </p>

    <h4>Configuration Files</h4>
    <p>
        If this is a new installation (or if upgrading from a version earlier than v5.1.0),
        create a configuration file as described in the <a href="/support/documentation/proget/installation/config-files">ProGet Configuration Files</a> documentation.
    </p>

    <h4>ProGet's Identity</h4>
    <p>
        ProGet may be configured to use its own domain account or may run as
        <i>Network Service</i> as long as the account has read/write access to the packages directory.
    </p>

    <h4>Database Installation</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Create a database called ProGet on the desired server
        </li>
        <li>
            Unzip <b>ProGet-SqlScripts.zip</b> into an empty directory and open a command prompt/PowerShell
            window in that directory. Run the <code>dbupdater.exe</code> executable with the following arguments:
<pre>
dbupdater.exe . &lt;ConnectionString&gt;
</pre>
            For example:
<pre>
dbupdater.exe . "Data Source=localhost; Initial Catalog=ProGet; Integrated Security=true;"
</pre>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Service Installation</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a directory named <b>Service\</b> under <b>C:\ProGet\</b></li>
        <li>Unzip <b>ProGet-Service.zip</b> into <b>C:\ProGet\Service\</b></li>
        <li>
            Install the service. To do this, run <b>ProGet.Service.exe</b> and display help to discover
            the arguments for the "install" option. Administrator elevation is required to install the
            service and reserve URLs for self-hosted installations. If you do not reserve a URL the
            integrated web server will not be enabled.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Web Application Installation</h4>
    <p>
        The web application may be hosted either by IIS or self-hosted by the integrated web server
        hosted by the service depending on how the service was installed above.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a directory named <b>WebApp\</b> under <b>C:\ProGet\</b></li>
        <li>Unzip <b>ProGet-WebApp.zip</b> into <b>C:\ProGet\WebApp\</b></li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        For IIS hosted applications, there are 2 additional steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Create an application pool in IIS to run under the appropriate identity;
            a classic (non-integrated) pipeline is preferred as this is usually easier to get working,
            but ProGet will typically run in either configuration.
        </li>
        <li>
            Create a website that points to <b>C:\ProGet\WebApp</b> using
            whichever host name configuration or ports preferred. <b>Note</b>: A virtual
            directory is not supported at this time. Verify that the website is using the
            application pool created in the previous step.
        </li>
    </ol>
