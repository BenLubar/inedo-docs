    <h1>ProGet Installation Guide</h1>
	<p>
		This is a step-by-step guide to installing ProGet on Windows and provides some detail as to what's
		happening behind the scenes.
	</p>

	<h2 id="pre-install">1. Pre-Installation Check List</h2>
	<p>
        ProGet doesn't have any intense server requirements, and supports all modern version of Windows that Microsoft supports (see <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet">Windows lifecycle fact sheet</a>). The recommended requirements are:
	</p>
	<ul class="docs">
		<li>
			<strong>Minimum</strong> – 2 Core CPU, 2 GB RAM, 1 GB for storage
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Recommended Average/Typical</strong> – 2 Core CPU, 4 GB RAM, 10 GB storage
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Recommended Large </strong> –  4 Core CPU, 8 GB RAM, 16 GB Storage
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Before installing, consider the following:
	</p>
	<ul class="docs">
		<li>
			<strong>.NET Framework 4.5.2</strong> – ProGet requires .NET 4.5.2, and Windows will prompt about this if you don't already have it
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Web Server</strong> – ProGet has its own web server, but can also be hosted in Microsoft IIS; if you want to use IIS, make sure it's installed first
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Database Server </strong>– ProGet does require Microsoft SQL Server, but the ProGet installer can install SQL Express for you
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Disk Space</strong> – ProGet does not use a whole lot, but your packages might
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Firewall (Inbound)</strong> – ProGet is a web application and can be installed on the port of your choosing
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Firewall (Outbound)</strong> – Connectors within ProGet connect to external NuGet feeds, and therefore require outbound access
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="download">2. Download ProGet</h2>
	<p>
		There is just one installer for all editions of ProGet, which you can download from
		<a href="/proget/download">download</a> on inedo.com.
	</p>

      <h2 id="verify">3. Verify the Installer</h2>
          <p>
                We always sign our installer packages. This signature can be seen when you run the installer and get a security warning, or right-click on the file
                for Properties and then look at Digital Signatures.
          </p>
          <img class="screenshot" alt="" src="http://inedo.com/resources/knowledgebase/ProGet-Installation-Guide_E6DE_image_2.png" />
          <p>
                We've never had any issues with compromised installers (it's hosted on Amazon S3, which is quite reliable),
                but it doesn't hurt to make sure the signature is there.
          </p>

      <h2 id="run-install">4. Run the Installer</h2>
          <p>
                The installer requires administrative privileges to run and will attempt to escalate.
                It will then unpack the temporary files and begin installation verification.
          </p>



      <h2 id="agreement">5. License Agreement</h2>
          <p>
                Take a quick read of our license agreement. Really, it's quick.
          </p>
          <img class="screenshot" alt="ProGet Installer" src="/resources/documentation/proget-installation/Progetinstaller.png" />

          <h2>6. Edition / License Key</h2>
          <p>
                After accepting the license agreement, select the edition of ProGet you'd like to use (Free or Enterprise Trial).
          </p>
          <img class="screenshot" alt="License Key Edition" src="/resources/documentation/proget-installation/progetedition.png" />

      <h2 id="registration">7. License Registration</h2>
          <p>
                After selecting the edition, just enter your name and email. The installer will try to get this from the currently logged in user.
          </p>
          <img class="screenshot" alt="License Registration" src="/resources/documentation/proget-installation/progetlicense.png" />

      <h2 id="directory">8. Target Directory</h2>
          <p>
                Deploy to your favorite location, or just stick with the default of Program Files.
          </p>
          <img class="screenshot" alt="Target Directory" src="/resources/documentation/proget-installation/progettargetdirectory.png" />

      <h2 id="database-configuration">9. Database Configuration</h2>
          <p>
                If you ran the installer with the embedded SQL Express, then you'll be able to select the option to install SQL Express:
          </p>
          <img class="screenshot" alt="Database Configuration" src="/resources/documentation/proget-installation/progetdatabase.png" />
          <p>
                Otherwise, you'll need to point to an existing server using a standard SQL Connection string.
                Note that if no database is specified in the connection string (which is the default), a database named ProGet will be created.
          </p>

      <h2 id="web-server-configuration">10. Web Server Configuration</h2>
          <p>
                By default, the installer will configure ProGet to use its own web server. This is the easiest to start with, and you can always switch to IIS hosting later.
          </p>
          <img class="screenshot" alt="Web Server Configuration" src="/resources/documentation/proget-installation/progetwebserver.png" />
          <p>
                If IIS is installed on the server, you will have the option of installing ProGet in IIS.
                This will create an application pool and website in the local IIS configuration.
          </p>
      <h2 id="user-account">11.User Account </h2>
        <p>
            By default, the installer will use the Network Service account to run the ProGet Service and Web Application. We Recommend sticking with this, and changing the account later if you need to.

            <img class="screenshot" alt="Install in Progress" src="/resources/documentation/proget-installation/useraccount.png" />
        </p>
      <h2 id="summary">12.Summary</h2>
      <p>
          Make sure everything here looks OK, and then click Install.
          <img class="screenshot" alt="Summary" src="/resources/documentation/proget-installation/summary.png" />

      </p>

          If any of the items indicate an error, you can click on it to go back to that page and fix it.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Patiently Wait</h2>
          <p>
                If you chose to have SQL Server Express installed, then the actual installation process will take a while,
				as the installer must download the SQL installer and then wait for it to complete.
                On some servers, we've seen this take as long as fifteen minutes.
              <img class="screenshot" alt="Install in Progress" src="/resources/documentation/proget-installation/progetclickinstall.png" />

          </p>
          <p>
                Clicking cancel (especially during the SQL Express installation) is not advised, as you may have to manually remove some bits of SQL Server
                using Add/Remove programs. Once everything's done, you'll be ready to start using ProGet.
