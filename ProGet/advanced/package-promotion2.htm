    <h2 id="package-promotion">Package Promotion</h2>
    <p>
        Packages can be <em>promoted</em> from one feed to another. This is useful for maintaining
        feeds with separate levels of quality (such as Development, Production, etc), and also to
        easily curate selected packages from an external source to an approved repository.
        </p>
    <p class="info">This feature is available in paid and trial ProGet editions.</p>
        <p>
        Check out our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uVDUt0wMjM">Promote Packages with ProGet</a>
        video for a quick look at some of the ways to use Package Promotion.

    <h2 id="deployment-records">Deployment Records</h2>
    <p>
        When a package is deployed from a feed using a tool (such as <a href="/buildmaster">BuildMaster</a> or <a href="/hedgehog">Hedgehog</a>)
        ProGet records information about that deployment, such as the target and the user that
        performed the deployment.
