            ProGet provides a robust infrastructure for hosting and distributing your application and component packages, and oftentimes it can be convenient to distribute assets related to those packages – certificate files, third-party installers, license key files, etc. - in ProGet as well.
    </p>

    <p>
            While you could certainly package these files, they are inherently un-versioned, require no additional metadata, and packaging and unpackaging would create extra and unnecessary steps. Sometimes, a file is just a file, and ProGet asset directories provide the versatility of a file share, with the added benefit of security and stability features such as <a href="/support/documentation/proget/administration/security">scoped privileges</a>, retention policies, and automatic failover.

                    Example: An installer may be used by a configuration script for setting up a workstation. The installer is already a self-contained package, so packaging it further would be redundant; it just needs to be downloaded and executed. It could simply be stored in an Asset Directory, and referenced by URL.

            Asset Directory
    </h2>
    <p>
            An asset directory is a like a <a href="/support/documentation/proget/core-concepts/feeds">feed</a>, except for arbitrary files instead of package files. You can access these files from your web browser and the RESTful API.
    </p>
    <p>
            Internally, asset directories are represented as feeds, which means:
    </p>
<ul class="docs">
    <li>
        feed-scoped privileges can be applied on asset directories </li>
           <li> you can configure Amazon S3 and Azure blob storage </li>
       <li> <a href="/support/documentation/proget/administration/retention-rules">retention policies</a> work just like regular feeds, except version number-based policies do not apply </li>
      <li>  the asset directory name cannot be the same as another feed name

    </li>
</ul>
<div class="attention analogy">
        <img src="/resources/images/icons/analogy.png" />
        <p>
                Note: <a href="/support/documentation/proget/core-concepts/feeds/connectors">Connectors</a> and <a href="/support/documentation/proget/advanced/feed-replication">feed replication</a> are not currently supported for asset directories, but may be added in a future release. Please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> if you are interested in these additions.
        </p>
</div>
<p>
        To create an asset directory, go to Assets > Create Asset Directory.
</p>
  <h2>
      Files in an Asset Directory
  </h2>
  <p>
        Files can be added to an asset directory in a number of ways. You can:
  </p>
  <ul class="docs">
<li>Upload File; upload a single file using your browser.</li>
<li> Import Archive; upload a .zip or .tgz file using your browser and expand its contents into the asset directory </li>
     <li>   Upload using API; use the Asset Directory API to upload one or more files to the asset directory.</li>
     <li>  Upload Large File or Multiple Files; upload a large file (1GB+) or multiple files at once. This is only supported for asset directories that use the directory package storage mechanism.
        </li>

  </ul>
  <p>
        Files in an asset directory can also be accessed as if they are hosted on a web server by navigating to the file's URL (see <a href="/support/documentation/proget/reference/asset-directories-api">asset directory API</a>). This URL is also displayed on the file information page in the Web UI.
  </p>
  <h3>
      Deleting Files
  </h3>
  <p>
        You can delete a file in asset directory by clicking the "X" on the file listings page, the "Delete File" button on the file overview page, or by using the <a href="/support/documentation/proget/reference/asset-directories-api">asset directory API</a>.
  </p>
  <h3>
      Media Types
  </h3>
  <p>
        When you upload a file to an asset directory, ProGet will attempt to determine the file's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type">media type</a>. The media type is sent as a content-type response header when the file is downloaded, which may be used by the downloading application or script.
  </p>
  <div class="attention analogy">
                <img src="/resources/images/icons/analogy.png" />
  <p>
        For example, if the content-type is application/msword, then a web browser may open Microsoft Word to display the file. You can change the file's media type by navigating to the file in the web UI, and clicking the <em>set</em> option.
  </p>
</div>
  <h3>
Subdirectories
  </h3>
  <p>
        Similar to a file system, you can use subdirectories to organize the files in an asset directory. Subdirectories may also contain other subdirectories.
  </p>
  <p>
        You can delete a subdirectory by clicking the "X" on the file listings page or by using the asset directory API.
