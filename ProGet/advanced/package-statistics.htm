        ProGet tracks the use of packages in your feeds to help you decide which packages are being used, which packages are taking a lot of disk space, and which packages are frequently cached.
   </p>
   <h2>
       All Feed Disk Usage
   </h2>
      <p>
            On the ProGet Overview page, you can see how much total disk space each feed is using.
      </p>

     <h2>
         Feed-specific Disk Usage Statistics
     </h2>
     <p>
            On the Manage Feed page, you can identify if any packages are consuming a disproportionate amount of disk space, as well as how much cached packages (i.e. packages downloading from connectors) are using.
     </p>

      <p>
            This can help you when you define <a href="/support/documentation/proget/administration/retention-rules">retention rules</a> to cut back on disk space usage if needed.
      </p>
      <h2>
          Package Statistics
      </h2>
      <p>
            ProGet can also be configured to track individual package downloads and record every user that downloads every package.
      </p>
      <p class="info">
            This feature is available in paid and trial ProGet editions.
        </p>
        <p>
                Because this can potentially consume a lot of database disk space, you must first enable it by going to Administration > Advanced Settings and checking the Package Statistics enabled box. Once enabled, ProGet will record the following information each time a package file is requested:
        </p>
        <ul class="docs">
            <li>
                  <b>  Username</b> – the name of the authenticated user who downloaded the package, or “Anonymous” if the user was not logged in
            </li>
            <li><b>IP Address</b> - the IP address that requested the package</li>
            <li><b>User Agent</b> - the user agent header that was sent in the download request</li>
            <li><b>Date/time</b> - the specific date/time the package was downloaded</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
                Viewing in the UI
        </h3>
        <p>
                On the Package page, you can see an aggregate of download data by clicking on the Package Statistics button on a package overview page.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Advanced Reporting
        </h3>
        <p>
                For more advanced analysis of package downloads, you can query the <code>ProGet SQL</code> Server database directly. Each download record is stored in the <code>PackageDownloads</code> table.
