    <p>
            The <a href="/den/inedox/vorsecurity">OSS Index extension</a> provides a Vulnerability Source that will automatically import vulnerability reports from various public databases using <a href="https://ossindex.sonatype.org/" target="_blank"> Sonatype's OSS Index</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="connect">Connecting to OSS Index </h2>
    <p>
        If you're not an OSS Index user, you'll need to make an account and request a trial license or purchase a professional license. This can be done by visiting <a href="https://ossindex.sonatype.org/" target="_blank">https://ossindex.sonatype.org/</a> > selecting the user icon in the top right corner > Register for an account.
      </p>
        <div class="attention best-practice">
           
            <p>
              <strong>Note:</strong> Sonatype <a href="https://www.sonatype.com/sonatype-acquires-vor-security-announces-lifecycle-xc">recently acquired</a> Vor Security; in ProGet v5.0 and earlier, OSS Index was Vor Security. If you were previously a Vor Security user, your account has been automatically migrated over to OSS Index. 
            </p>
        </div>
    
    
    <p>
        Once logged into OSS Index you can copy the API token.
    </p>

    <p>
        After retrieving the API token from OSS Index, set it as your Vulnerability Source in ProGet by going to <em>Administration</em> > <em>Manage Vulnerability Sources</em> > <em>Create Vulnerability Source</em>.
    </p>
   
    
   
    <h2 id="managing-assessments">Create an Assessment </h2>
    
    <p>
        To create a new Assessment type go <em>Administration</em> > <em>Manage Assessment Types</em> > <em>Create Assessment Type</em>.
    </p>
    <div class="attention analogy">
        <img src="/resources/images/icons/analogy.png" />
        <p>
            When a vulnerability is detected, it is automatically assigned to the unassessed type, and will require user assessment before being usable.
        </p>
    </div>

   
    <h2 id="feed-level">Feed Level Configuration </h2>

    <p>  Vulnerability sources are scoped at the feed level and can be added on a feed-by-feed basis. Since <a href="/support/documentation/proget/administration/security">Security and Access Controls</a> are also scoped at the feed level, you are able to permit and restrict access to who is allowed to assess vulnerabilities. </p>
    <p>
        Go to the <em>feeds</em> tab and select a feed to add the vulnerability source to. Then select <em>Manage Feed</em> > <em>add source</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once the source is added, any package vulnerabilities found will be labeled <i>Unassessed</i>, and will be available for assessment.
    </p>
   

    <h2 id="assess-vuln">Assessing Vulnerabilities</h2>

    <p>
        After you've added a vulnerability source, any known vulnerabilities will be available for assessment. These are viewed by clicking the <i>Vulnerabilities</i> tab.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Select any of the vulnerabilities listed to view additional details, and assign an assessment status. Click <em> assess</em> to select a new assessment type.
    </p>
    <div class="attention best-practice">
       <p> Assessments can have a set expiration which will force reassessment. This ensures that compliance needs are continually addressed and that security standards are upheld as development continues.
        </p>
