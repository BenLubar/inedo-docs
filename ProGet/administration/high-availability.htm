			ProGet's distributed architecture
            allows you to use any number of servers for
            both load-balancing and automatic failover purposes, such that one server node
			can take over in the event of any other server failure or outage.
		</p>
        <p>
            There are five key components to a High Availability configuration.
        </p>

        <h3 id="load-balancer">Load Balancer</h3>
        <p>
            The load balancer will direct traffic bound for the ProGet web application, evenly distributing traffic during heavy load times.
        </p>
        <p>
            ProGet was built to be compatible with any load-balancing platform, whether software-based
            (such as HAProxy, NLP, or nginx) or appliance-based (such as F5, A10, Citrix).
        </p>
        <ul class="docs">
            <li>
                <b>Not Required: Session Affinity (sticky sessions)</b> - while you can enable this, it's not required
                and may simplify your traffic and load balancer configuration.

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Common Machine Key</b> - you will need to use a common machine key amongst web nodes, see
                <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/w8h3skw9(v=vs.100).aspx">Microsoft's documentation</a> for
                how to configure this in your web.config or machine.config files
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            If you are new to load balancing, Microsoft's <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc771008.aspx">Network Load Balancing Cluster</a>
            is relatively easy to configure.
        </p>

        <h3 id="web-node-configuration">Web Node Configuration</h3>
        <p>
            Any number of servers may be configured as web nodes; to ensure high-availability, at least three nodes are required. More may be added
            to distribute load and ensure rapid responses.
        </p>
        <p>
            To configure a web node, see the <a href="/support/documentation/proget/installation/manual">manual installation instructions</a> and
            follow only the web application instructions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once complete, from any web server, click on the <b>Configure Load Balancing</b> link on the ProGet administration page,
            then click on the <b>Enable Load Balancing</b> button.
        </p>

		<h3 id="shared-storage">Shared Storage</h3>
		<p>
			ProGet is compatible with any type of common storage that web and indexing nodes can access, whether
            software-based (SAMBA share, Windows Server Storage Spaces, etc) or appliance-based (dedicated NAS).
            The only requirement is that the storage is readable and writeable by all nodes.
		</p>

        <h3 id="database-cluster">Database Cluster</h3>
        <p>
            ProGet can work with any SQL Server Cluster configuration, regardless of the failure detection mechanism and failover policy.
            SQL Server's Database Mirroring may also be used, although note that Microsoft has depricated the feature in favor of AlwaysOn Availability Groups.
        </p>


		<h3 id="indexing-nodes">Indexing Nodes</h3>
        <p>
            Any number of indexing nodes may be configured; to ensure high-availability, at least two nodes are required.
        </p>
        <p>
            To configure an indexing node, see the <a href="/support/documentation/proget/installation/manual">manual installation instructions</a> and
            follow only the service instructions.
        </p>
		<p>
            Once complete, from any web server, click on the <b>Configure High Availability Mode</b> link on the ProGet administration page,
            then click on the <b>Enable High Availability Mode</b> button.
		</p>
        <p>
            Once enabled, the <i>Indexing Cluster Health</i> box on the administration page will replace
            the <i>Service Status</i> box. Clicking on the <i>More Info</i> link will display the
            Indexing Cluster Status page. On this page, you can see the status of every server in your
            cluster, as well as which server is currently the primary server. If a server is no longer
            in your cluster, you may delete it by clicking the appropriate red X button.
