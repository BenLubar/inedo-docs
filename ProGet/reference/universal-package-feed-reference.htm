        Universal Package Feeds were designed to provide immediate, out-of-the-box functionality for most packaging needs, and also to serve as a platform that you can easily extend or interact with.

            <b>Shared Documentation Note</b> - instead of creating a whole new set of documentation for Universal Packages and Feeds we've kept the detail pages in the Various Documentation, and the ProGet specific things are noted on these pages:
        </p>

        <ul class="docs">
            <li><a href="/support/documentation/various/universal-packages/universal-feed-api">Universal Feed API &amp; Package Reference</a></li>
            <li><a href="/support/documentation/various/universal-packages/universal-package-registry">Universal Package Registry</a></li>
            <li><a href="/support/documentation/various/universal-packages/upack-reference">UPack Command-line Tool</a></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
        <h4>UPack Command-line Tool</h4>
        <p>
            <em>upack.exe</em> is a standalone command-line tool to aide in the creation of universal packages, and is
            typically used on build servers or in other automation scenarios.
        </p>

        <h4>Universal Package Registry</h4>
        <p>
            <a href="/support/documentation/proget/feed-types/universal">Universal Feeds and Packages</a> are "lightweight" and, on their own, have very few built-in features. This design has allowed them to be utilized for all sorts of packaging problems such as application delivery, Inedo's product extensions, and even private Bower packages.
        </p>
        <p>
            When developing a package-based solution, one question that often comes up is "what packages are installed or used in this particular context?" That's where the Universal Package Registry comes in; it's a local package registry designed specifically for Universal Packages.
