        ProGet offers a variety of API endpoints for working with feeds and managing ProGet.
    </p>

    <h3 id="feed-specific">API for Third-party Packages and Feed Types</h3>
    In order to support third-party package formats types like NuGet, npm, etc., ProGet implements a variety of third-party APIs. We don't provide documentation for these APIs, as they are generally quite complicated and rarely fully documented. However, you can generally find the basics by searching for specific things you'd like to do with the API, such as "how to search for packages using the NuGet API" or "how to publish an npm package using the API".

            As we are with the <a href="/support/documentation/otter/reference/api">Otter APIs</a> and <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/reference/api">BuildMaster APIs</a>,
            we will continue to add simpler endpoints to ProGet that will be easier to consume than the Native API.

    <h3 id="native">ProGet Native API</h3>
    <p>
        The ProGet Native API is a lower-level API that's designed to automate installation and management of a ProGet instance. It's not terribly intuitive,
        but its documented here: <a href="api/native">ProGet Native API Reference</a>
