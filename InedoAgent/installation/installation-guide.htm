    <h2>Using the Installer</h2>

    <h3 id="pre-install">1. Pre-Installation Check List</h3>
    <p>
        There are no intense server requirements, and support all modern version of Windows (7+/2008+).
        Before installing, consider the following:
    </p>
    <ul class="docs">
        <li>
            <strong>.NET Framework 4.5.2</strong> – Requires .NET 4.5.2 or later; this is already installed on
            Windows Server 2012, and you can <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653" target="_blank">download it from Microsoft</a> on
            earlier servers
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Firewall (Inbound)</strong> – the agent will listen on the port of your choosing
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="download">2. Download Otter Windows Agent</h3>
    <p>
        When you click the "Create Server" button on the Servers page in your Otter or BuildMaster installation, you'll be given a direct link
        to the file with the correct version. You can also find it on the <a href="/otter/versions">all Otter downloads</a>
        page or the <a href="/buildmaster/versions">all BuildMaster downloads</a> page. Make sure to select the version that corresponds with your version of Otter or BuildMaster, which can be found in the bottom-right
        corner in your web browser.
    </p>

    <h3 id="directory">3. Target Directory</h3>
    <p>
        Although you may install wherever you like, it is recommended to
        keep the temporary directory short to avoid potential issues with tools that
        have problems with long paths.
    </p>

    <h3 id="user-account">4. User Account</h3>
    <p>
        By default, the agent service will run as <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms677973(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank">LocalSystem</a>, which is an administrative service account.
        While not required, administrator-level privileges are strongly recommended as it will eliminate any
        difficulty or confusion with moving files and running different operations.

    </p>

    <h3 id="network">5. Network</h3>
    <p>
        We recommend using the default port (46336), as that's Inedo's
        <a target="_blank" href="http://iana.org/assignments/port-numbers">officially designated port</a>.
        Make sure that the selected port is not blocked by a firewall.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can change this later by editing the configuration file in the installation directory, and restarting the
        service.
    </p>

    <h3 id="encryption">6. Encryption</h3>
    <p>
        Inedo's agents use a FIPS-compliant symmetric AES encryption scheme by default, and the installer will
        automatically generate a secure, 32-digit key for you. You can use that key, or another one of your choosing.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you select SSL instead of built-in AES, then you will need to have a valid certificate installed on the server
        (see <a href="/support/kb/1040">KB#1040</a>).
    </p>
    <p class="announcement">
        <b>No Encryption</b> is also an option, but we don't recommend using it. The primary reason we have this is so
        that you can use a tool like <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/" target="_blank">Wireshark</a> to inspect
        the individual messages, either as directed by our support engineers or because you really like studying
        binary TCP protocols.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can change this later by editing the configuration file in the installation directory, and restarting the
        service.
    </p>

    <h3 id="summary">7. Summary</h3>
    <p>Verify that the information here is correct and then click Install.</p>


    <h3 id="installation">8. Installation</h3>
    <p>
        The actual installation is near instantaneous, and should take no more than a minute or two, even on the slowest
        of systems.
    </p>

    <p>Once the installation is complete, just close the installer or click the Exit button.</p>

    <h2 id="multiple">Installing Multiple Agents on Same Machine</h2>

    <p>Sometimes, it may be desired to install multiple instances of the Inedo Agent on the same machine. The most common reason for this is privileges; one agent may run in a higher privilege mode than the other.</p>

    <p>The automated and manual agent installer do not currently support this, but <a href="/support/kb/1146">KB#1146</a> will provide guidance on how to do this.</p>
