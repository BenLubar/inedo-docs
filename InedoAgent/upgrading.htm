    <p>
        Because the Inedo Agent is essentially a lightweight host for product-specific agents
        (see <a href="/support/documentation/inedoagent/overview#arch">General Architecture</a>),
        updating the Inedo Agent has not been necessary.
    </p>

    <p>
        At this point, we have not released a new version of the Inedo Agent with anything other than potential fixes for
        unreproducible bugs. Thus, there is no compelling reason to upgrade your Inedo Agent, unless you have been directed to
        by an Inedo support engineer.
    </p>

    <p>
        We do have <a href="/support/documentation/inedoagent/roadmap">several planned changes</a>, and will include
        a mechanism in our products to perform an automatic update. Until then, you can manually upgrade the agent by running the
        installer or through the manual process.
    </p>

    <h2>When to Upgrade</h2>
    <p>
        Generally speaking, you shouldn't need to upgrade unless you are directed to by an Inedo support engineer, or a
        new version your Inedo tool (Otter, BuildMaster, etc). When we introduce that feature in our products, we will update this
        documentation to explain why.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you came across this page through browsing or searching, and you are getting random agent errors, you are certainly
        welcome to try a different version.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, it might not help, and might not be worth your time to upgrade. While it probably won't introduce regressions,
        you may prevent an error from happening in the future.
    </p>

    <h2>Upgrade Risk/Notes</h2>
    <p>
        All changes between <a href="/support/documentation/inedoagent/versions">versions</a> have been small bugfixes,
        and would have been considered <i>maintenance</i> releases. Down the line, we may change versioning schemes to be more
        reflective of the scope of change, especially if we make a <i>minor</i> or <i>major</i> level change.
