    <p>
        Because the Inedo Agent is essentially a lightweight host for product-specific agents
        (see <a href="/support/documentation/inedoagent/overview#arch">General Architecture</a>),
        updating the Inedo Agent is usually not necessary.
    </p>

    <p>
        To help upgrade the Inedo Agent, BuildMaster includes an feature that 
        [automatically updates the Agents](/support/documentation/buildmaster/administration/agents#automatic-updates).
        You can also upgrade an Inedo Agent by running the installer (or by following the manual process) on the server itself.
        
    </p>

    <h2>When to Upgrade</h2>
    <p>
        Generally speaking, you shouldn't need to upgrade unless you are directed to by an Inedo support engineer, or a
        new version your Inedo tool (Otter, BuildMaster, etc). When we introduce that feature in our products, we will update this
        documentation to explain why.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you came across this page through browsing or searching, and you are getting random agent errors, you are certainly
        welcome to try a different version.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, it might not help, and might not be worth your time to upgrade. While it probably won't introduce regressions,
        you may prevent an error from happening in the future.
    </p>

    <h2>Upgrade Risk/Notes</h2>
    <p>
        All changes between <a href="/support/documentation/inedoagent/versions">versions</a> have been small bugfixes,
        and would have been considered <i>maintenance</i> releases. Down the line, we may change versioning schemes to be more
        reflective of the scope of change, especially if we make a <i>minor</i> or <i>major</i> level change.
