          The Inedo Agent is a lightweight Windows service that allows a server to be orchestrated using a
          connected instance of BuildMaster, Hedgehog, or Otter. Orchestration includes:

      <ul class="docs">
          <li>File system access - ability to read and write files/directories</li>
          <li>Remote code execution - methods in .NET assemblies can be invoked in a remote context</li>
          <li>Remote process execution - executables can be launched with output streamed back</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="arch">General Architecture</h2>
      <p>
          The Inedo Agent follows a standard client-server architecture, although the terminology may seem a bit counterintuitive at first,
          because the Inedo Agent is actually operating as a server: it services multiple requests simultaneously from one or more clients.

      <p>
          BuildMaster and Otter products are the clients; using their service and web application, the products connect
          to an Inedo Agent installed on a server.
