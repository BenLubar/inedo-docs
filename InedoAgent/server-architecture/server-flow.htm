    <p>This is the series of events which occurs when a client (product) connects to an Inedo Agent:</p>

    <ol style="margin-left: 30px;">
        <li>The client (BuildMaster, Hedgehog, or Otter) opens a TCP socket to the server (InedoAgent.exe) and sends a 24-byte Handshake message</li>
        <li>The server sends a <a href="/support/documentation/inedoagent/server-architecture/network-protocol">Handshake</a> acknowledgement to the client</li>
        <li>The server is now ready to receive a message from the client</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The server will then wait for commands from the connected client. These connections are relatively short-lived, and kept open for the duration of deployment, configuration, or orchestration executions.</p>

    <p>The following events occur when an InedoAgent.exe receives a message that targets a product host process:</p>

    <ol style="margin-left: 30px;">
        <li>InedoAgent.exe forwards message the product host process using the shared-memory buffer</li>
        <li>The product host process reads the message and processes it</li>
        <li>If the messages requires a response, the product host process sends a message to InedoAgent.exe using the shared-memory buffer</li>
        <li>InedoAgent.exe forwards messages to connected clients</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Also note that, while servers can have multiple connected clients, a client will generally share a single session across multiple executions.</p>
