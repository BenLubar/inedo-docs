        <em>OtterScript</em> is a Domain-Specific Language that was designed in tandem with the 
        <a href="/support/documentation/otter/execution-engine/overview">execution engine</a> to represent  <a href="../core-concepts/plans#configuration">configuration plans</a> and 
        <a href="../core-concepts/plans#orchestration">orchestration plans</a> in Otter, and
        deployment plans in BuildMaster. Because a DSL is inherently limited in functionality, a key feature of
        is the ability to "drop down" to a <a href="../modeling-infrastructure/powershell">lower-level scripting language</a>
        as needed.
    </p>
    <p>
        While OtterScript is neither a general-purpose programming language (like Ruby), nor a general-purpose mark-up language (like YAML), it was inspired
        by both, and allows you to build declarative and imperative plans.

            <b>Shared Documentation Note</b> - instead of copy/pasting the documentation (or creating a whole new set of documentation for OtterScript),
            we've kept the OtterScript detail pages in the Various Documentation, and the very few things that are Otter-specific are noted on these pages:

    <h2 id="design-goals">Language Design Goals</h2>
    <p>
        In addition to implementing the <em>actual</em> requirements of an advanced execution engine capable of executing
        across thousands of servers, we built OtterScript with these factors in mind:
    </p>
    <ul class="docs">
        <li>easy to learn for those with little to no programming experience</li>
        <li>familiar and intuitive to those with intermediate programming experience</li>
        <li>extensible and powerful for those with programming and domain expertise</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In fact, using the Visual Mode in the plan editor, many users may not even realize they're building plans using <em>OtterScript</em>.

        As you become more familiar with the execution engine, this reference section will help you accomplish even more things using Otter.
