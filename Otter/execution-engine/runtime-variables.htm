        Variables allow for extreme flexibility when modeling your infrastructure, and creating <a href="/support/documentation/otter/core-concepts/plans">Plans</a>.
        There are a lot of uses for variables, some of the most common are:
    </p>
    <ul class="docs">
        <li>Arguments/properties of <a href="overview#operations">Operations</a></li>
        <li>Conditional execution using a <a href="statements-and-blocks/if-else">If/Else Block</a></li>
        <li>Iteration/enumeration using a <a href="statements-and-blocks/loop">Loop Block</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Like <a href="../global-components/configuration-variables">Configuration Variables</a>, which are essentially values that you can
        assign to a <a href="/support/documentation/otter/core-concepts/servers">Server</a>, <a href="/support/documentation/otter/modeling-infrastructure/server-roles">Server Role</a>, <a href="/support/documentation/otter/modeling-infrastructure/environments">Environment</a>, etc., runtime variables are used by the <a href="/support/documentation/otter/execution-engine/overview">Execution Engine</a> while running a plan.
    </p>
    <h2 id="types">Runtime Variable Types</h2>
    <p>
        There are three types of runtime variables, and each is denoted by a prefix.
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr><th>Prefix</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr>
        <tr><td>$</td><td>String</td><td>a single value</td></tr>
        <tr><td>@</td><td>List</td><td>an enumerable set of either Lists or Strings</td></tr>
        <tr><td>%</td><td>Map</td><td>a set of key/value pairs with values being a String, List, or Map</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        String variables are the most common, and are used just about anywhere. Whenever you reference a string variable within another
        block or statement, it is automatically replaced with the value. You can escape this with the grave apostrophe 
        (<code>`</code>) character.

        <tab name="Execution Log"><img class="screenshot" src="/resources/documentation/otter/variable-log.png" alt="Setting a Variable in Otter" /></tab>
    </tab-block>

    <p>
        List variables are used much less frequently, primarily as the source of a 
        <a href="statements-and-blocks/loop">Loop Block</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Map variables are pretty rare, and are only used in operations needing an arbitrary list of key/value pairs
        (like the <code>HTTP::Post</code>) or in other really advanced scenarios.
    </p>

	<h2 id="scoping">Runtime Variable Scoping</h2>
	<p>
        When you create a runtime variable with the <a href="/support/documentation/otter/execution-engine/statements-and-blocks/other-statements#set-variable">Set Variable Value</a> statement, that variable will
        be accessible in the current and nested blocks. For example:
	</p>
    <tab-block>
        <tab name="Visual Mode"><img class="screenshot" src="/resources/documentation/otter/variable-nested-pic.png" alt="Setting a Nested Variable in Otter" /></tab>
        <tab name="Text Mode (OtterScript)"><img class="screenshot" src="/resources/documentation/otter/variable-nested-text.png" alt="Setting a Nested Variable in Otter" /></tab>
        <tab name="Execution Log"><img class="screenshot" src="/resources/documentation/otter/variable-nested-log.png" alt="Setting a Nested Variable in Otter" /></tab>
    </tab-block>
	<p>
		While setting both runtime and <a href="/support/documentation/otter/global-components/configuration-variables">Configuration Variables</a> may lead to confusion if over used, Otter does allow for greater re-use of plans and templates by allowing the same plan or template to be used at different development environments where things like certificates, keys, and data might <em>need</em> to be different for testing.
	</p>

    <h2 id="relation">Relation to Configuration Variables</h2>
    <p>
        When a string variable is referenced in your plan, the execution engine first checks to see if there is a
        runtime variable with that name in the current scope. If not, then a configuration variable with that name
        is retrieved.  We generally don't recommend doing this, as it may get quite confusing if others are trying
        to understand your plan.
    </p>
	
    <h2 id="variable-functions">Variable Functions</h2>
    <p>
        You may have seen expressions like <code>$PathCombine($RootPath,Accounts)</code> used in previous examples; these are
        variable functions, which take in a number of parameters and return a value.
        All of the "built-in variables" like <code>$WorkingDirectory</code>, <code>$EnvironmentName</code>, and
        <code>@AllServers</code> are implemented as variable functions.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can create configuration or runtime variables with the same name of a variable function, but we don't recommend
        it because it can get quite confusing if others are trying to understand your plan. If there is a variable of
        the same name, that value will be used instead, unless you explicitly reference the
        parameter list (such as <code>$EnvironmentName()</code>).
    </p>
    <p>
        Variable functions are extensible, so you can write your own with an <a href="../administration/extensions">Otter Extension</a>.
