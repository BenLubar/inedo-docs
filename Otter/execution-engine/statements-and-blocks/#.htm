        The execution engine interprets a <a href="../core-concepts/plans">Plan</a> as a series of statements and blocks, in
        a top-down manner. 
    </p>
    <ul class="docs">
        <li>
            <b>Statements</b> - 
            most of the statements in your plans will be <a href="overview#operations">Operations</a>, but there are a few 
            <a href="/support/documentation/otter/execution-engine/statements-and-blocks/other-statements">Other Statements</a> that can be used to build extremely advanced plans.</li>
        <li>
            <b>Blocks</b> - 
            blocks contain statements and other blocks, and help with organization, flow, and error control; there are 
            four block types:
            <ul class="docs">
                <li><a href="statements-and-blocks/general-blocks">General Blocks</a></li>
				<li><a href="statements-and-blocks/loop">Loop Blocks</a></li>
				<li><a href="statements-and-blocks/try-catch">Try /Catch Blocks</a></li>
                <li><a href="statements-and-blocks/if-else">If/Else Blocks</a></li>             
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you're comfortable with programming or scripting, you'll probably already be familiar with how these blocks work. There is a 
        <a href="../reference/otter-script/formal-specification">formal specification</a> available if you want to know <em>precisely</em> how 
        the execution engine and plans/OtterScript work.
    </p>
    <h2 id="blocks">Blocks</h2>
    <p>
        Blocks provide an easy way to organize your plans, and the sub-tasks those plans are made of. They can be nested as many levels deep 
        as you need. All blocks provide variable scoping (i.e. if you set a variable in that block, it will only 
        be available within that block) as well as log scoping. 
    </p>
    <h2 id="logs">Log Scoping</h2>
	<p>
		Otter's logs were designed to be as easy to navigate and understand as plans. this is where collapsible log scopes come in: 
	</p>
    <tab-block>
        <tab name="Plan"><img class="screenshot" src="/resources/documentation/otter/log-scoping-block.png" alt="IIS block" /></tab>
        <tab name="Execution Log"><img class="screenshot" src="/resources/documentation/otter/log-scoping-log.png" alt="IIS block log" /></tab>
    </tab-block>
    <p>
        If you give a block a <b>short description</b>, then the plan's execution log will have a scope of the same name. This way, as you 
        nest statements and blocks in your plans, they will have parity in the log. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Because logs may contain sensitive data, such as the arguments to a command line, you can <a href="/support/documentation/otter/administration/security">Restrict Users</a> from viewing debug-level logs.
        This offers an ideal mix between security/compliance and visibility. 
    </p>
    <h2 id="assets">Assets in Plans</h2>
    <p>
        When an <a href="../core-concepts/assets">Asset</a> (template plan or script) is used in a plan, it is run as an operation, and can be 
        treated in the same way (moved within a plan and have custom configurations). It is logged as an operation as well.
