        General Blocks allow you to define properties that operations will use, and that will control how contained statements and blocks
        run.

    <ul class="docs">
        <li>
            <b>Current Server</b>:
            sets the server used for execution of operations; you can only use this in an orchestration plan with a job that does not target any servers
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Server Role</b>:
            determines whether the current server in context has that role, and skips the block if it does not
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Working directory</b>:
            sets the current working directory that file-based Operations will use
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Asynchronous</b>:
            when specified (along with an optional token), the entire block will run asynchronously (see below).
        </li>
       
        
        <li>
            <b>Timeout</b>:
            the number of seconds to wait for the contained items to run; if they don't run in this time, an error will be raised
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Retry count</b>:
            if any of the contained items raise an error, then the entire block (and all nested blocks) will be run as many times 
            specified; if a retry succeeds, then the execution status will not change
        </li>
        
    </ul>

	<h3 id="async">Asynchronous Blocks</h3>
	<p>
		An <i>asynchronous</i> block works just like a general block, except the execution will continue
		with the statement/block immediately following the asynchronous block, while the asynchronous block
		runs in the background. In this way, multiple long-running blocks can execute in parallel.
	</p>
	<p>
		An <i>Await Asynchronous Operation</i> statement will suspend the current execution until all asynchronous blocks have
		been completed. The execution engine adds an implicit <i>await</i> to the end of any plan
		if there are background blocks running, but you can always await sooner if part of your plan
		depends on the asynchronous blocks completing.
	</p>
	<p>
        If an asynchronous block is given a token, then this token must be supplied to an await statement to act as a filter; that is, only asynchronous blocks with that specific token will be awaited.
	</p>
	<p class="info">
		When an <i>await</i> statement is executed, the execution status is inherited from the
		background block if it is in an error or warn state. An <i>await</i> statement can
		be enclosed inside a <a href="/support/documentation/otter/execution-engine/statements-and-blocks/try-catch">Try/Catch</a> block to handle any recoverable errors that happened
		in the background.
