        An API Key is used to grant programmatic access to Otter, and allows scripts, tools, and other integrations to automate and interact with the system.
    </p>
    <h2 id="creating-keys" data-title="Creating API Keys">Creating and Managing API Keys</h2>
    <p>
        To create or manage API Keys, go to Administration > API Keys and Access Logs. You will be presented with a list of
        API Keys in the system, as well as the ability to edit, delete, and create new ones.
    </p>
    <p>
        The most important property of an API Key is the <b>Key</b>. This is an arbitrary string that acts like a password,
        so make sure to treat it like one. You can set the key value to anything you'd like, or let Otter auto-generate a value for you.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <b>Description</b> field is used for a human-friendly name, and can be used to describe what the key is used for.
    </p>

        A key can only be used for the API endpoints that you specify:
    </p>
    <ul class="docs">
        <li>Native API</li>
        <li>Job orchestration (Viewing and/or Triggering)</li>
        <li>Infrastructure management (Viewing and/or Updating</li>
        <li>Variables Management API</li>
        <li>Configuration Management API</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="attention analogy">

        <p>
            Granting access to the <a href="/support/documentation/otter/reference/api">Native API</a> will effectively allow for full control of the instance.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h4>Logging Options</h4>
    <p>
        You can configure an API key to log both the request and the response body of each request. While this is important for debugging purposes, if you have a lot of large requests, there will be a nontrivial overhead and amount of diskspace required.
    </p>

    <h2 id="using" data-title="Using API Keys">Using API Keys</h2>
    <p>
        An API key may be passed to any endpoint (except Feed API endpoints - see below) in one of four ways, depending on the content type of the expected request:
    </p>
    <ul class="docs">
        <li>Request header (x-Apikey) - all content types</li>
        <li>Querystring value (key) - all content types</li>
        <li>Form value (key) - only applications/x-www-form-urlencoded content type</li>
        <li>JSON property (API_Key) on root object - only application/json content type</li>
    </ul>
