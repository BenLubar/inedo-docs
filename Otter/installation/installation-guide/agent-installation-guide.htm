    <p>
        To facilitate communication between Otter and the Windows servers you want to configure and orchestrate, Otter
        uses a lightweight agent with a highly-optimized and resilient protocol. Installing agents is even easier than
        installing Otter, and the <a href="/support/documentation/various/inedo-agent/installation">Agent Installation Guide</a> will provide step-by-step instructions, as well as provide some detail as to what's
        happening behind the scenes.

    <p>
        Once the agent has been installed, the server must be added to Otter.
        Click the <strong>Create Server</strong> button on the <strong>Servers</strong> page, and enter the
        host name of the server, the port you installed the agent on, and the encryption key if you chose one.
