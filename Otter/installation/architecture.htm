        Otter is comprised of several different components, which may be installed on different
        servers. See the installation guides for more details.

    <h2 id="web-application" data-title="Web Application">Web Application</h2>
    <p>
        This is how most users will interact with Otter on a day-to-day basis, and
        manages the servers, plans, security, users, etc., and also hosts the API.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is a standard ASP.NET application, and administrators familiar with IIS may
        tweak the application pool settings as needed. Note that modifying the <code>web.config</code> file for
        any purpose other than to change the database connection string or encryption key is not at all supported.
    </p>

    <h2 id="service" data-title="Service">Service</h2>
    <p>
        This runs in the background and actually runs your <a href="../../core-concepts/plans">configuration and orchestration plans</a> using the
        <a href="../execution-engine">execution engine</a>.   It's a standard
        <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms685141(v=vs.85).aspx">Windows Service Application</a>,
        and may be managed and <a href="configuration-options">configured</a> using the Windows Service Manager or <code>sc.exe</code> as you see fit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that modifying the <code>Otter.Service.config</code> file for
        any purpose other than to change the database connection string or encryption key is not at all supported.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <a href="service">Service</a> page details how to administer this further.
    </p>

    <h2 id="database" data-title="Database">Database</h2>
    <p>
        This persists all the configuration data, execution logs, job schedules, users, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is a standard SQL Server database, and administrators familiar with SQL Server may
        tweak the database settings as needed.
    </p>
    <h3 id="encryption">Encryption</h3>
    <p>
        Sensitive data, most notably <a href="../global-components/resource-credentials">resource credentials</a>, are encrypted before being stored.
        Obviously, the encryption key is <em>not</em> stored in the database, but in both the <code>web.config</code> file
        (used by the <a href="#web-application">web application</a>) and the <code>Otter.Service.config</code> file (used by the <a href="#service">service</a>).
    </p>
    <h3 id="reporting">Reporting</h3>
    <p>
        Experienced users are welcome to query data from the various tables, and sensitive information
        <a href="../global-components/resource-credentials">resource credentials</a> are stored encrypted, and
        can only be decrypted by the service account.
        The tables/columns should be fairly
        obvious once you're familiar with the software, and <a href="/support/ticket">we can answer</a> any questions
        you may have about the data or relations.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not support... nay, we <em>strongly discourage</em> trying to modify any of the data in the tables directly.
        Instead, use the API or the non-internal Stored Procedures.
    </p>

    <h2 id="agents" data-title="Agents">Agents</h2>
    <p>
        Agents are a lightweight service that are installed on remote servers that you want to configure and orchestrate.
        They use a highly-optimized and resilient protocol, and are secured (by default) using a FIPS-compliant symmetric
        AES encryption scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
        Agents may also be configured to use SSL instead of built-in AES, see <a href="/support/kb/1040">KB#1040</a> for those instructions.
