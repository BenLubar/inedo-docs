        Assets make it easier to automate your infrastructure by leveraging existing scripts and files to create
        <a href="/support/documentation/otter/core-concepts/plans">Configuration and Orchestration Plans</a>
        and scale up.
    </p>
    <p>
        Moreover, you can restrict access to your assets by creating
        <a href="../global-components/rafts">
            Rafts
        </a> in various <a href="../modeling-infrastructure/environments">Environments</a> to restrict access to specific environments.
        This helps maintain and enhance compliance and security, and helps you build on the existing knowledge, tools, and scripts you have already invested in.

    <p>
        Otter's <a href="../modeling-infrastructure/powershell">Tight PowerShell and Scripting Integration</a> makes it easy
        to use your current scripts to automate your current infrastructure. Once you've added a PowerShell or Shell script as an asset, you can
        call it as an operation in a <a href="plans">Configuration or Orchestration</a> plan, and Otter will execute those scripts on the
        appropriate server, and store logs about their execution.
    </p>

    <h2 id="module" data-title="Module Plans">Module Plans</h2>

    <p>
        Modules are reusable <a href="plans">Plans</a> that can be called from another plan, or another module, as if it
        were an <a href="../reference/operations">Operation</a>. Like other plans, modules are created using the Otter Visual Mode Editor or <a href="/support/documentation/otter/reference/otter-script">OtterScript</a>, and consist of <a href="/support/documentation/otter/execution-engine/statements-and-blocks">Blocks</a>. Module's reusability allows for quick plan creation, and greater accuracy, by using known configuration pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
        Modules can be useful to spin up generic <a href="/support/documentation/otter/core-concepts/servers">Servers</a> for rapid testing in the cloud, such as a generic modules to create an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS Server</a> for short testing periods, or to create segments of configuration plans that will be used across different
        <a href="/support/documentation/otter/modeling-infrastructure/server-roles">Server Roles</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="other" data-title="Other Files">Other Files</h2>
    <p>
        Otter can store any file type that a server might need for configuration, such as SSL certificates, read-me text documents, license key files, etc.
        You can even store your pictures of
        <a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=Otters+Who+Look+Like+Benedict+Cumberbatch">Otters Who Look Like Benedict Cumberbatch</a>.
    </p>
    <p>These files can be deployed or ensured using the Get Asset and Ensure Asset operations.</p>
