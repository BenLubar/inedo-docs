    <h2 id="about" data-title="About Schedules">About Otter Schedules</h2>
    <p>
        Otter has a global list of named schedules that can be used to automatically run recurring jobs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recurring jobs using a schedule are run independently of the configuration drift setting of a server.
    </p>
    <p>
        A schedule simply defines the time (or times) when a job should run. Once created, a schedule may be
        assigned to any number of recurring jobs.
    </p>

    <h2 id="creating" data-title="Creating and Managing">Creating and Managing Schedules</h2>
    <p>
        Schedules can be created, editied, or deleted from the Administration -> Schedules page.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following configuration is available for a schedule:
    </p>
    <ul class="docs">
        <li>
            <b>Name</b> - Identifies the schedule in Otter.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Days of week</b> - Specifies which days of the week when jobs are allowed to run.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Starting at</b> - The time of day when the job should run (or if <b>interval</b> is specified, the
            time of day when the job should <i>first</i> run).
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Interval</b> - When specified, a job will run multiple times a day from the starting time to
            the ending time with this specified interval in between runs. Interval may be specified in
            hours and/or minutes (for example, 1h 30m).
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Ending at</b> - When specified with <b>interval</b>, detemines the time after which no more
            jobs will be run for the day. This value is ignored if <b>interval</b> is not set. When an explicit
            end time is not specified but an interval is specified, jobs will run until the end of the day.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Schedule is active</b> - When not checked, recurring jobs which use this schedule will never run.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="recurring-jobs" data-title="Recurring Jobs">Recurring Jobs</h2>
    <p>
        A recurring job can be created on the Jobs page under the <b>Recurring</b> tab. A recurring job
        has all of the same configuration as a <a href="../core-concepts/jobs">one-off job</a>, but also
        includes a schedule that determines when the job will run.
