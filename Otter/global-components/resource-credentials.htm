        Otter can manage, store, and control access to tokens, passwords, API keys, or any of the other secrets needed for automating modern infrastructure with the use of Resource Credentials.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can associate different credentials with different <a href="../modeling-infrastructure/environments">Environments</a>, and permit or restrict different <a href="/support/documentation/otter/administration/security">Users</a>
        from managing or viewing the actual passwords for credentials. Of course, credentials are always encrypted before being stored.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are several built-in types, and new types may be added with an <a href="../administration/extensions">Extension</a>:
    </p>
    <ul class="docs">
        <li>
            <b>Private Key</b> - a private key with an optional username and passphrase
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>BuildMaster</b> - a <a href="/support/tutorials/buildmaster/utilizing-infrastructure-sync">connection to the BuildMaster</a> API
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>ProGet</b> - a connection to a <a href="/proget">ProGet server</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Username &amp; Password</b> - just a simple username and password, such as a Windows domain account
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example: IIS Application Pool Credentials</h2>
    <p>
        In Microsoft's IIS, an Application Pool may be configured to run under a certain user account. Obviously, to do that, you must supply that username and password.
        Both of these fields are available on the <a href="../reference/operations/iis/ensure-app-pool">Ensure App Pool</a> operation, but that means you would need to have those values
        be stored in plain text, in your <a href="/support/documentation/otter/core-concepts/plans">Plan</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Alternatively, you could create a Username &amp; Password credential...</p>
    <p>
        <img class="screenshot" src="/resources/documentation/otter/resource-1.png" alt="Storing a Credential in Otter" />
    </p>
    <p>... and then specify that, for the Otter credentials property.</p>
    <p>
        <img class="screenshot" src="/resources/documentation/otter/resource-2.png" alt="Using a Credential in Otter" />
    </p>
    <p>
        Otter will automatically map the appropriate fields at configuration time, allowing you to give the team viability into which credentials are being used, without sharing the
        actual credentials themselves.
