        <p>Inedo has partnered with <a href="https://gibraltarsoftware.com">Gibraltar Software</a> in order to integrate <a href="https://onloupe.com">Loupe</a> with our products as part of our customer success initiative. This program is known as the <em>Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP)</em>, and this opt-in program offers the following benefits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improved logging and performance metrics</li>
            <li>Detailed error reporting</li>
            <li>Centralized, aggregate feature usage analysis</li>
            <li>Optional integration with customer-owned Loupe instances</li>
        </ul>
        <p id="data-usage">
            These features allow both Inedo and our customers to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide superior support through improved logging and reduced customer effort</li>
            <li>Determine and prioritize improvements for popular features</li>
            <li>Analyze performance data to reduce page load and deployment times</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="product-integration" data-title="Product Integration">Product Integration</h3>
        <p>CEIP functionality will be available in the following product versions going forward:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>BuildMaster 6.1</li>
            <li>ProGet 5.2</li>
            <li>Otter 2.2</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="how-do-i-opt-in" data-title="How do I opt-in?">How do I opt-in?</h3>
        <p>CEIP is disabled by default on new and existing installations. To opt-in, a product administrator may visit the Diagnostic Center of the Inedo product, and select the <em>Customer Experience &amp; Improvement</em> tab. This page will allow customers to enable the Loupe integration.</p>
        <h3 id="how-does-the-ceip-work" data-title="How does the CEIP work?">How does the CEIP work?</h3>
        <p>Once enabled, captured CEIP telemetry is constantly buffered to memory, then flushed to a highly-compressed local file, and periodically transmitted in aggregate to Loupe Server.</p>
