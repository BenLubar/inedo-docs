        Changing a license key within an Inedo product can be done via the “Licensing &amp; Activation” page where there will be a link to add or change a key. You may request a new key from <a target="_blank" href="https://my.inedo.com">MyInedo</a>.

        For Inedo Enterprise products that are licensed by user (i.e. BuildMaster &amp; Hedgehog), it is acceptable to assign and activate a current production key in the non-production environment provided that the same named users are covered under both instances. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For the products that are licensed by server (i.e. ProGet &amp; Otter), if an enterprise key is used in production, a separate server license must be purchased in order to configure a non-production instance for each additional server.

        In certain cases, an annual license can expire without a replacement key rendering an Inedo product unusable, for example, when a PO is still in the approval process, a license key was not received via email, the party responsible for the license is on vacation, and more. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Whatever the cause, you are permitted to request a free or trial license key from <a target="_blank" href="https://my.inedo.com">MyInedo</a> and use that in an installation until such time the normal enterprise key is released. This will not affect the expiration date of the new license.
