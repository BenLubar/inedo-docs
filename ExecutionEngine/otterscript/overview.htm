        <em>OtterScript</em> is a Domain-Specific Language that was designed in tandem with the 
        execution engine to represent  <a href="/support/documentation/otter/core-concepts/plans#configuration">configuration plans</a> and 
        <a href="/support/documentation/otter/core-concepts/plans#orchestration">orchestration plans</a> in Otter, and
        <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/core-concepts/deployment-plans">deployment plans</a> in BuildMaster. Because a DSL is inherently limited in functionality, a key feature of
        is the ability to "drop down" to a <a href="/support/documentation/executionengine/components/powershell-and-shell">lower-level scripting language</a>
        as needed.
    </p>
    <p>
        While OtterScript is neither a general-purpose programming language (like Ruby), nor a general-purpose mark-up language (like YAML), it was inspired
        by both, and allows you to build declarative and imperative plans.

        In addition to meeting implementing the <em>actual</em> requirements of an advanced execution engine capable of executing
        across thousands of servers, we built OtterScript with these factors in mind:
    </p>
    <ul class="docs">
        <li>easy to learn for those with little to no programming experience</li>
        <li>familiar and intuitive to those with intermediate programming experience</li>
        <li>extensible and powerful for those with programming and domain expertise</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In fact, using the Visual Mode in the plan editor, many users may not even realize they're building plans using <em>OtterScript</em>.
