	<p>
		Installable product packages are Universal Packages, and the hub uses a universal package
		feed hosted at inedo.com to download product releases and updates for the hub itself.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is still possible to use the Inedo Hub to install/manage products on a server that is not
		connected to the Internet, but it will take a little extra configuration. In order for
		the software to work, it needs to be able to query a Universal Package Feed for available
		product releases - you have two options for getting this to work on a disconnected server:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<b>Use ProGet</b> - If you have a ProGet instance on your local network, you can
			create a Universal Package Feed in it and then create a connector to the Inedo
			<a href="https://inedo.com/products/feed">product releases feed</a>. Make a note
			of the feed API Endpoint URL displayed in ProGet for the newly-created feed.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Use Directory</b> - Download the packages you need to a local directory.
			At a minimum, this should be the latest DesktopHub package and the desired
			ProGet package.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Once you have completed one of the above options, click the [config] link in the
		Inedo Hub and specify either the ProGet Feed URL or the file system directory
		containing downloaded packages for the Package Source field.
	</p>
