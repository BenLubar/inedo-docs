   <p>
       You can easily add new operations to BuildMaster, Hedgehog, and Otter using any .NET language.
   </p>
    <p>
        Follow this guide to create a simplified version of the Create File operation that is already included in the Inedo Core extension. First, make sure to create a project as outlined in <a href="/support/documentation/inedosdk/extending/creating">Creating an Extension using the Inedo SDK</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Next, create a new public class called <code>CreateFileOperation</code>, and have it inherit
        the <a href="/support/sdk-reference/inedosdk/Inedo.Extensibility.Operations/ExecutingOperation"><code>ExecuteOperation</code></a> class:
    </p>
<pre>
<span class="code-keyword">public class</span> CreateFileOperation : ExecuteOperation
{
}
</pre>

    <p>
        Since this operation is supposed to create a file, it would be nice if we could access
        the file name and what to put in the file as inputs. To do this, just add a couple of properties and attributes:
    </p>
<pre>
[Required]
[ScriptAlias("Name")]
[DisplayName("File name")]
public string FileName { get; set; }

[ScriptAlias("Text")]
[DisplayName("Contents")]
[Description("The contents of the file. If this value is missing or empty, a 0-byte file will be created.")]
public string FileText { get; set; }
</pre>

    <p>
        Here's what everything means:
    </p>
    <ul class="docs">
        <li>
            <b><a href="/support/sdk-reference/inedosdk/Inedo.Documentation/RequiredAttribute">Required</a></b> - the user must supply a value for this property for the plan to validate
        </li>
        <li>
            <b><a href="/support/sdk-reference/inedosdk/Inedo.Extensibility/ScriptAliasAttribute">ScriptAlias(name)</a></b> - this is what the name of the property will look like to OtterScript;
            this value is required and must be unique to the type of operation
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>[DisplayName(name)]</b> - this is displayed in the graphical plan editor to provide a friendlier
            name than the script alias; this is optional
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>[Description(text)]</b> - another optional attribute that provides some additional help
            text in the graphical editor
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Now that the inputs are configured, write the code that will actually create the file:
    </p>
<pre>
public override async Task ExecuteAsync(IOperationExecutionContext context)
{
	var path = PathEx.Combine(context.WorkingDirectory, this.FileName);
	var fileOps = context.Agent.GetService&lt;IFileOperationsExecuter&gt;();
	this.LogDebug($"Creating {path}...");

	await fileOps.CreateDirectoryAsync(PathEx.GetDirectoryName(path));
	await fileOps.WriteAllTextAsync(path, this.Text ?? "");

	this.LogInformation(this.FileName + " file created.");
}
</pre>

    <p>
        Although the <a href="/support/sdk-reference/inedosdk/Inedo.Extensibility.Operations/ExecuteOperation/ExecuteAsync(IOperationExecutionContext)">ExecuteAsync</a> method isn't doing too much, we'll break everything down right here:
    </p>
    <ul class="docs">
        <li>
            <b>async</b><br />
            The <b>async</b> keyword in the method declaration instructs
            the compiler to allow the <b>await</b> keyword in the method body. Otter
            operations can execute asynchronously; if you don't know what this means, consider
            reading <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh191443.aspx" target="_blank">this MSDN article</a>.
            If you would prefer to implement <b>ExecuteAsync</b> synchronously, you can just omit
            the <b>async</b> keyword and return the static <b>Complete</b> property when the method
            is complete.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>var path = PathEx.Combine(context.WorkingDirectory, this.FileName);</b><br />
            This allows a relative path to be used for the <b>FileName</b> property.
            Without it, the operation would only work correctly when a user supplies
            an absolute path. Note that absolute paths will still work; if the
            second argument of <b>PathEx.Combine</b> is absolute, the first argument
            is ignored.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>var fileOps = context.Agent.GetService&lt;IFileOperationsExecuter&gt;();</b><br />
            This requests a <b><a href="/support/sdk-reference/inedosdk/Inedo.Agents/IFileOperationsExecuter">IFileOperationsExecuter</a></b> service from the
            Otter agent in the current context. This interface is an abstraction
            that allows a common set of file system operations on either hosted
            or SSH agents.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>await fileOps.CreateDirectoryAsync(PathEx.GetDirectoryName(path));</b><br />
            This is a simple way to ensure that the directory exists where
            we are trying to write the file.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>	await fileOps.WriteAllTextAsync(path, this.Text ?? "");</b><br />
            This actually writes the desired text to the file.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="info">
        For brevity, we've left out the logging messages; but those are pretty self-explanatory.
        Anything logged will be associated with the current operation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now apply a few attributes to the operation itself to make it discoverable to Otter:
    </p>
<pre class="tutorial-code">
[DisplayName("Create File (Example)")]
[Description("Creates a file on a server.")]
[ScriptAlias("Create-File-Example")]
[ScriptNamespace("HDARS")]
[Tag("files")]
[DefaultProperty(nameof(FileName))]
<span class="code-keyword">public class</span> CreateFileOperation : ExecuteOperation
{
}
</pre>

    <p>
        The meaning of <b>DisplayName</b>, <b>Description</b>, and <b>ScriptAlias</b>
        is the same as for properties. As for the other attributes:
    </p>
    <ul class="docs">
        <li>
            <b><a href="/support/sdk-reference/inedosdk/Inedo.Extensibility/ScriptNamespaceAttribute">ScriptNamespace</a></b> - specifies a prefix that is used to qualify the
            name specified in <b>ScriptAlias(name)</b> - For convenience, this attribute
            can also be applied to the assembly rather than on each operation individually.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b><a href="/support/sdk-reference/inedosdk/Inedo.Documentation/TagAttribute">Tag</a></b> - specifies a tag which acts as a kind of category for the operation.
            This attribute can be applied multiple times and can help with discoverability.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>DefaultProperty</b> - specifies the name of a property on the operation
            that receives the default argument value. When in script form, the default argument
            is the value this is passed to the operation positionally, rather than by name.
            A default is not necessary, but can help increase the readability of a plan
            when it is viewed or edited as OtterScript.
        </li>
    </ul>
