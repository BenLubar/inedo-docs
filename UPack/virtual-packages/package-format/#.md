  There's not much to virtual package; it's just a JSON-based text file with a `.vpack` file extension.

  The file is formatted just like a [universal package manifest](/support/documentation/upack/universal-packages/metacontent-guidance/manifest-specification) (e.g. `upack.json`), and follows the same specification, except that there are **two additional properties**:

| Property      | Format |
| ----          | -------
| `contents<sup>R</sup>` | An *array* of at least one item, containing any of the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; *string* - [package identification](/support/documentation/upack/universal-packages/package-identification) <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; *string* - an absolute url to an HTTP or HTTPS file resource <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226; *object* - [virtual content objective](/support/documentation/upack/virtual-packages/package-format/specifications#virtual-content-object) |
|metaContents | *same as contents property*

The `contents` property is required.
