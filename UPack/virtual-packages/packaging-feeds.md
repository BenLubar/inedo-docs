 Virtual packages are designed to act transparently within a supported universal feed.

**Note:**

- You will need to use the [List Versions](/support/documentation/upack/feed-api#list-versions) endpoint in order to determine if a package is virtual.
- The [Download Packages](/support/documentation/upack/feed-api#download-package) endpoint will simply assemble the package, and send it as a regular package.
