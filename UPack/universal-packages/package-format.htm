    <p>
        There's not much to a universal package file; at a minimum it:
    </p>
    <ul class="docs">
        <li>is a ZIP archive format with a <code>.upack</code> file extension</li>
        <li>has a <a href="/support/documentation/upack/universal-packages/metacontent-guidance/manifest-specification">manifest file</a> at the root level of archive named <code>upack.json</code> with a few required fields</li>
        <li>contains any number of files in the <code>/package</code> directory; these files are the files that will get "unpackaged" by the client or server</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You can add any number of files or directories outside of these minimal requirements - and in fact, that's exactly what universal packages are designed for.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the <em>extremely unlikely</em> event that a future version of this specification will require, or uses additional files (we can think of absolutely no reason this would ever be required), then these will be opt-in and specified using the manifest, or potentially use a <code>.upack2</code> extension.
    </p>
