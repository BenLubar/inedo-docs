        Files and directories stored outside of the ZIP archive's <code>/package</code> directory are referred to as <em>metacontent</em>, and the
        <code>upack.json</code> manifest file is the only required metacontent in a package.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike actual content, there is no "general purpose" usecase for metacontent. Instead, think of it as a tool to help you build a specification for a package
        format that is based on a universal package. For example, <a href="/romp">romp packages</a> define several metacontent files and folders that are used to
        help install the <code>/package</code> contents.
