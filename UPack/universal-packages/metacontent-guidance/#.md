Files and directories stored outside of the ZIP archive's ```/package``` directory are referred to as *metacontent*, and the ```upack.json``` manifest file is the only required metacontent in a package.

Unlike actual content, there is no "general purpose" usecase for metacontent. Instead, think of it as a tool to help you build a specification for a package format that is based on a universal package. For example, [romp packages](/romp) define several metacontent files and folders that are used to help install the ```/package``` contents.
