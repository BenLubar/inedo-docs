There's not much to a universal package file; at a minimum it:

- is a ZIP archive format with a `.upack` file extension
- has a <a href="#manifest">manifest file</a> at the root named `upack.json` with a few required field

Files within the `/package` directory are refereed to as /content/ (and will be "unpackaged" by the client or server), and all other files are /metacontent/.

You can add any number of files or directories outside of these minimal requirements - and in fact, that's exactly what universal packages are designed for.

In the <em>extremely unlikely</em> event that a future version of this specification will require or uses additional files (we can think of absolutely no reason this would ever be required), then these will be opt-in and specified using the manifest, or potentially use a `.upack2` extension.

### Package Metacontent & Guidance{#metacontent data-title="Package Metacontent & Guidance"}
Files and directories stored outside of the ZIP archive's `/package` directory are referred to as *metacontent*, and the `upack.json` manifest file is the only required metacontent in a package.

Unlike actual content, there is no "general purpose" usecase for metacontent. Instead, think of it as a tool to help you build a specification for a package format that is based on a universal package. For example, [romp packages](/romp) define several metacontent files and folders that are used to help install the `/package` contents.
