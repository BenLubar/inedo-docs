    <p>
        A universal package can be uniquely identified it's group, name, and version. These are different properties in the <a href="/support/documentation/upack/universal-packages/metacontent-guidance/manifest-specification">manifest file</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In some cases, you will need to refer to a package with a single string. In this case, the group and name are combined into a single string,
        separated by a forward-slash, and the version is followed (separated by a colon).
        If a package is not in a group, then it's considered in the <em>empty</em> group, and that slash is not used. For example:
    </p>
    <ul class="docs">
        <li><code>HDARS:1.3.9</code> is version 1.3.9 of the HDARS package (which is in the empty group)</li>
        <li><code>initrode/vendors/abl/ABLast:2.2.1-rc.1</code> is rc.1 prerelease of v2.2.1 of ABLast in the "initrode/vendors/abl" group</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="attention best-practice">
        <img src="/resources/images/icons/best-practices.png" />
        <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> you should avoid really generic names for your packages, like "Utils" or "Tool". Instead, consider InitechUtils or InitrodeTool.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        You may also append a colon and then a hash string to the end of a package. This will be used for verification purposes when possible.
        For example:
    </p>
    <ul class="docs">
        <li><code>HDARS:1.3.9:fca66ce2a8ceea2d651eecf2369d4072d1871aec</code></li>
        <li><code>initrode/vendors/abl/ABLast:2.2.1-rc.1:5b31eaa26d0c6e7bb985f740dbceed854293c369</code></li>
    </ul>
