A Universal Package is intended to be read-only, and once created, its contents and metacontents sealed within the package, untampered. However, the simple format of a Universal Package makes it easy to tamper with its contents using nothing more than a zip file editor.

This is where cryptographic hashing comes in. It is a small string of text that acts as a "thumbprint" of a file and lets you verify that, after you've downloaded "Accounts/HDars v1.3.4" from a package source, you can be certain it's the file you expect.

Because a package's hash is calculated from the bytes of the package file, it is impossible to store a package's hash inside of that package, since changing the package would change its hash. For this reason, a trusted package source should be used to verify the hash of the package.

#### Package Hash Format {#package-hash-format}

Package hashes are calculated using the SHA-1 algorithm, and encoded visually as a 40-character case-insensitive string of hexidemical digits without spaces or other separator characters. For example: `2660bf74fc8147ca41bd53bdb1defc3aae35bc91`
