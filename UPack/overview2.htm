    <p>
        UPack is a technology-neutral packaging platform that allows you to uniformly distribute your applications and components across environments to enable consistent deployment and testing.

      <p>
          Universal Package Feeds were designed to be provide immediate, out-of-the-box functionality for most packaging needs,
          and also to serve as a platform that you can easily extend or interact with.

      <h3>
          Universal Package Versions
      </h3>
      <p>
          The Universal Package Files themselves are designed to be both backwards- and forwards-compatible. This is easily accomplished because the minimum requirements for what makes a universal package are incredibly minimal. Thus, changes will always be additive and their usage will be optional.
      </p>
      <iframe width="600" height="337" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Si3eWq1yHXs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

      <p>
          In the extremely unlikely event that a future version of this specification is not compatible (we can think of absolutely no reason this would ever be), these would likely be exposed as a totally different format (like a .upack2 extension).
      </p>

      <h2>UPack Specifications:</h2>
      <p>
          All of the UPack tools adhere to the following set of specifications. The specifications were designed to be easy to understand and implement for your own use cases.
      </p>
      <h3><a href="/support/documentation/upack/universal-packages/package-format">Universal Package</a></h3>
      <p>
          A ZIP archive containing any sort of content, along with a simple, JSON-formatted manifest file describing that content using built-in or additional metadata.
      </p>
      <h3><a href="/support/documentation/upack/virtual-packages/what-is">Virtual Package</a></h3>
      <p>
          A JSON-formatted file that behaves like a universal package, but with contents that are downloaded and assembled at install time.
      </p>
      <h3><a href="/support/documentation/upack/universal-package-registry/what-is">Universal Package Registry</a></h3>
      <p>
          A JSON-formatted file that describes what packages are installed in a particular context (on a server, in an application), as well as when it was installed, who installed it, and why it was installed. It also provides for a package cache, in case packages need to be reinstalled or audited.
      </p>
      <h3><a href="/support/documentation/upack/feed-api">Universal Feed</a></h3>
      <p>
          An HTTP-based API used to list, download, and publish universal package files to a web-based package manager like ProGet.
