            <strong>ADVANCED TOPIC WARNING:</strong> this documentation is technical, perhaps too technical for casual reading; it was primarily written to provide a very detailed specification for how it works behind the scenes. 
        </p>

    <p>
        An execution represents a deployment, orchestration, routine task, synchronization, or any other type of job that is run by the service using the <a href="/docs/executionengine/overview">Inedo Execution Engine</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        All execution records are stored in the database, have scoped logs, and the following properties:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul class="docs">
            <li>Execution ID</li>
            <li>Start / End Dates</li>
            <li>Run State: Pending, Executing, Completed</li>
            <li>Execution Status: Normal, Warn, Error</li>
            <li>Execution Type</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Different types of executions will have additional properties as well.
