                Hedgehog takes your applications and services to production faster by defining reusable workflows that automate testing, deployment, and if necessary, rollback.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can manage everything from Hedgehog’s web-based dashboard; create a self-service deployment platform for multiple teams that meets your organization’s security and compliance requirements.

                Hedgehog uses Inedo’s advanced execution engine and agent technology that enterprises across the world use to scale their deployments to thousands of servers and the cloud.
