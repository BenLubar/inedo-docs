            While Hedgehog's software itself is production-ready, it's a v1 product meant for early adopters.
            Like all v1 products, Hedgehog's future is uncertain. While we designed it to eventually take BuildMaster's place that day may never come.

    <p>
        Hedgehog takes your applications and services to production faster by defining reusable workflows that
        automate testing, deployment, and if necessary, rollback.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can manage everything from Hedgehog’s web-based dashboard; create a self-service deployment platform for
        multiple teams that meets your organization’s security and compliance requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hedgehog uses Inedo’s advanced execution engine and agent technology that enterprises across the world use to
        scale their deployments to thousands of servers and the cloud.
