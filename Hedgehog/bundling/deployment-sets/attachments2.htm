           Attachments are an advanced topic.
        </p>

    <p>
            There are some cases where you may want to "attach" files to a deployment set without creating and publishing an entire package to an external source.  This is exactly where an attachment can come in.

                For example, one of the stages in your pipeline may generate a "release notes" HTML file and a later stage may email that file to customers after a release engineer verified the file looks acceptable.

        <p>
            Attachments are essentially zip files that are stored in a directory that Hedgehog manages, which can be on a local disk or a network share. Each zip file is associated with a deployment set, and these zip files can be uploaded or downloaded from the web user interface, as well as created and deployed using the <em>Create-Attachment</em> and <em>Deploy-Attachment</em> operations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike universal packages, attachments have no metadata associated with them, or even version numbers. They are merely a zip file that is attached to a package. In addition to the "release notes" example, you can do all sorts of things with attachments, such as importing build output directly from a CI server, or even create an end-to-end continuous delivery workflow, where Hedgehog retrieves and compiles your source code.
