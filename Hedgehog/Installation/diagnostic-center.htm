    <p>
        The diagnostic center is intended to diagnose known issues in Hedgehog and contains log messages that otherwise
        would not be captured by other subsystems. For example, infrastructure synchronization occurs in the context of an execution, which maintains
        its own logging for diagnostic purposes. However, if there were some reason it failed outside the scope of the synchronization,
        a message would be logged in the diagnostic center. At this time, only the latest 1000 
        messages are preserved and if more are written, the oldest messages are purged.

    <h3 id="message-levels">Message Levels</h3>

    <p>
        By default, only messages with warning or error level are logged. If more verbosity is required, the level can be changed from the
        Diagnostic Center page, or by setting the value of the <code>Diagnostics.MinimumLogLevel</code> value to one of the following values:
    </p>

    <ul class="docs">
        <li> 0 - <code style="color: #bbb;">debug</code></li>
        <li>10 - <code>information</code></li>
        <li>20 - <code style="color: #ee9d66;">warning</code></li>
        <li>30 - <code style="color: #de5948;">error</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Any value supplied will implicitly include any higher levels.
        The debug setting should only be used when diagnosing a known issue as it can affect performance of the system.
