          To facilitate communication between Otter and the Windows servers you want to configure and orchestrate, Hedgehog
          uses a lightweight agent with a highly-optimized and resilient protocol. Installing agents is even easier than
          installing Hedgehog, and the <a href="/docs/various/inedo-agent/installation">Agent Installation Guide</a> will provide step-by-step instructions, as well as provide some detail as to what's
          happening behind the scenes.

      <p>
          Once the agent has been installed, the server must be added to Hedgehog.
          Click the <strong>Create Server</strong> button on the <strong>Servers</strong> page, and enter the
          host name of the server, the port you installed the agent on, and the encryption key if you chose one.
