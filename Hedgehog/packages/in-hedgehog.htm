        Hedgehog deploys packages to servers and environments. These packages can contain your application components, as well as infrastructure configuration and deployment code.

            Think of a package like a uniform-sized shipping box with uniform, machine- and human-readable labels describing the package. Inside the box are the things you want to deliver, and the box may even include assembly, installation, delivery or other instructions on what to do with the contents.

    <p>
        Packages have become a unifying concept across a DevOps toolchain because they are built once, and deployed consistently across environments. This means everyone can be certain that what goes to production is exactly what was built and tested.
