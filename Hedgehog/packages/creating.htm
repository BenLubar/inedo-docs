            There's not a whole lot to a package: it's just a zip file containing the files you actually want to distribute, as well as a manifest file that describes the package itself.  There are a lot of options for creating and publishing packages to a feed, either from a developer's workstation, a build server, or anywhere else:

        You can also use Hedgehog's <a href="/docs/hedgehog/deliver-deploy/execution-engine">advanced execution engine</a> to help you create packages by setting up a <a href="/docs/hedgehog/bundling/releases">release</a> and <a href="/docs/hedgehog/deliver-deploy/pipelines">pipeline</a> that imports build artifacts from Jenkins, grabs files from a network drive, or even creates them directly using msbuild.

    <p>
            There are two ways to deploy your packages with Hedgehog: 
    </p>
   <ul class="docs">
       <li>Quick Deploy; an ad-hock deployment of a single package to any number of servers</li>
       <li><a href="/docs/hedgehog/bundling/deployment-sets">Deployment Sets</a>; a multi-stage deployment of one or more packages that can use approvals, templates, and project based security</li>
   </ul>

    <div class="attention best-practice">
        <img src="/resources/images/icons/best-practices.png" />
        <p>
            Hedgehog's Quick Deploy function is similar to running [romp install] in [interactive mode], except you also select which servers to install the package on. <br/><br/>Before using Quick Deploy, you will need to set up a [package source] and at least one [server] to deploy the package on. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Package Selection:</strong> after selecting package source from a list of configured sources, select the specific package and version to deploy from the autocomplete/search boxes</li>
            <li><strong>Variables:</strong> the selected package's metadata will be inspected, and the required and optional [package variables] will be displayed<br/><br/> <i>Note: all values are treated as [OtterScript expressions]. This is mostly useful for entering [configuration variables] for package variables, and $, @, and % character literals should be escaped with <code>'</code></i></li>
            <li><strong>Credentials:</strong> the package's required credentials will be displayed, providing an ability to select credentials stored in Hedgehog <br/><br/> <i>Note: we may support entering credentials directly in the future; for security purposes, you must enter them under Admin > Resource Credentials first</i></li>
            <li><strong>Deployment Plan:</strong> you will be prompted to select either the package's built-in install.otter plan or select a plan stored within Hedgehog</li>
            <li><strong>Server Targeting:</strong> you can select either Servers by Name or Environments + Roles to target servers. Servers are deployed to in parallel.<br/><br/><i>Note: when selecting Environments + Roles, the Roles act as an "or" while the Environments act as an "and"; that is, a server in any of the listed roles in all of the listed environments will be targeted.</i></li>
            <li><strong>Schedule Deployment:</strong> you can select Execute Immediately or Schedule Deployment. </li>
            <li><strong>Summary:</strong> once all quick deploy options are configured, a summary of all options will be displayed.</li>
        </ol>
