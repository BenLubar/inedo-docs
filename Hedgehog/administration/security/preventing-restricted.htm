        Because a deployment plan can reference a server by name, users who have permission to edit a deployment plan could easily reference a restricted server (such as production), thus defeating any deployment restriction policies. To prevent this, you can elect to "restrict deployments" to that server.
    </p>
    <p>
        At runtime, when a restricted server is requested, if the server is not associated with the targeted environment (or, if no environment was specified on the pipeline target), then a runtime error will occur. This allows you to grant a wide array of permissions while keeping narrow restrictions, such as:

    <p>
        <ul class="docs">
            <li>
                permission to edit plans, pipelines, and deploy packages
            </li>
            <li>
                restriction to deploy packages to production
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        <p>
            This can be unexpected and frustrating behavior, and we generally don’t recommend it except for when there’s a need for restricted servers.
