Security and access control policies are defined by giving principals (users or groups) permission to perform certain tasks in a certain scope (such as a project or environment).

:::attention{.analogy}
For example, you can say “The 'HDARS Developers' group may 'Deploy Packages' in the 'HDARS' project.
:::

Principals are defined in a user directory, which is either internal (i.e. built-in to Hedgehog) or external (such as Active Directory and LDAP). This allows you to create a single sign-on experience while letting other members of the organization manage user accounts and group membership.

You can also restrict principals from performing tasks, such as “The 'Developers' group may not Deploy Packages in a 'Production' environment.” These overlapping rules, as well as externally-defined user directory, can be used to model granular access control policies.
