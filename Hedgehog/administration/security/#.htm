    <p>
        Security and access control policies are defined by giving principals (users or groups) permission to perform certain tasks in a certain scope (such as a project or environment). For example, you can say “The 'HDARS Developers' group may 'Deploy Packages' in the 'HDARS' project.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Principals are defined in a user directory, which is either internal (i.e. built-in to Hedgehog) or external (such as Active Directory and LDAP). This allows you to create a single sign-on experience while letting other members of the organization manage user accounts and group membership.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also restrict principals from performing tasks, such as “The 'Developers' group may not Deploy Packages in a 'Production' environment.” These overlapping rules, as well as externally-defined user directory, can be used to model granular access control policies.
