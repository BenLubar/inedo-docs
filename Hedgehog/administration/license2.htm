        Hedgehog is licensed by number of users on an annual or perpetual basis. Hedgehog Free Edition includes all the features of Hedgehog Enterprise with two important differences:  
    </p>
      <ol>
          <li>
              Every authenticated user in the system is authorized to perform any function, effectively making every authenticated user a System Administrator
          </li>
          <li>
              "View-only" access for all unauthenticated users (see <a href="#guest-tasks">Specific Guest Account Tasks</a> for complete list of granted task attributes)
          </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
          Users in Hedgehog Enterprise are granted a license the moment they log-in to the software, at which point they become named users. 
      </p>
     <p>
         If a license grant increases the number of named users beyond the number of licensed users as determined by the license key, a licensing error will be generated and require administrator intervention. Named users are listed on the "Licensing &amp; Activation" page within the software, and can be delicensed at any time, allowing another user to claim the license, or to fix licensing errors that would occur if named users exceed the number of users permitted by the license key.
