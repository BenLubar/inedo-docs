    <p>
        To deploy your applications and releases, Hedgehog uses an advanced execution engine
        that's capable of running thousands of different operations and scripts on thousands of different servers.

    </p>
    <p>
        While Hedgehog's execution engine is an integral part of Hedgehog itself, the core engine was designed to be shared across products,
        and is also used in <a href="/otter">Otter</a> (our Infrastructure as Code tool) and <a href="/romp">Romp</a> (a stand-alone, command-line tool).
    </p>

    <!--<h2 id="operations">Operations</h2>
    <p>
        Operations are the tasks that the execution engine will run on a server. Hedgehog ships with dozens of <a href="../reference/operations">built-in operations</a> and
        there are a number of extensions available that add even more. You can add more through <a href="../administration/extensions">Hedgehog Extensions</a>, to see a list of all of our extensions head over to the <a href="/den">Inedo Den</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some operations are quite simple (Sleep), while others are quite complex (Synchronize Files across Servers). Through a combination of Operations, Scripts, Variables, and Blocks, you will
        be able to model any plan to deploy an application to an environment.
    </p>-->

    <h2 id="otter-script">OtterScript in Hedgehog</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="/support/documentation/executionengine/otterscript/overview">OtterScript</a> is a Domain-Specific Language that was designed in tandem with the execution engine to represent
        <a href="/support/documentation/otter/core-concepts/plans#configuration">configuration plans</a> and
        <a href="/support/documentation/otter/core-concepts/plans#orchestration">orchestration plans</a> in Otter,
        and <a href="/support/documentation/hedgehog/deliver-deploy/deployment-plans">deployment plans</a> in Hedgehog.
    </p>
    <p>
        You really don't need to learn OtterScript; it's simply the textual representation of a plan, and plans are already fully editable in the   drag-and-drop plan editor.
        If you switch back-and-forth between visual and code modes, you'll probably learn it on your own, but it's also pretty well documented.
